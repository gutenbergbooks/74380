<h3>
PROLOGUE.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
A woman's tongue is ever slow<br>
To tell the thing she does not know.<br>
</p>

<p>
There was a large dinner-party in Grosvenor
Square at the house of Lord Kesterton, one of
the new peers.
</p>

<p>
"Are you thoroughly enjoying your glories
and honours?" inquired Lady Eleanor Gregory of her
host, who had taken her down to dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must confess that I feel rather like the man
who lost his wife, and said it was 'verra dull but verra
peaceful'; and I have come to the conclusion that peace
is an acquired taste."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you hanker after the fighting in your dear
old House of Commons?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Kesterton smiled.  "I am afraid I still babble o'
green benches when I get the chance.  The House of
Commons is like certain women of one's acquaintance:
you quarrel with them, and they expect too much from
you, and you vow you will enjoy yourself and have
nothing more to do with them; but, all the same, they have
spoilt your taste for anything else, and they make all
other women seem insufferably dull."
</p>

<p>
"And now I have got to scold you for dismissing my
poor, dear Harry," said Lady Eleanor.
</p>

<p>
"Uncork the vials of your wrath," replied her host,
"and I will endeavour to suffer and be strong."
</p>

<p>
"I shall appeal to Mr. Madderley to second my vote
of censure," continued the lady, turning to the Royal
Academician who sat at her right hand.  "I suppose I
ought to talk to you about art, but I am going to talk to
you about politics."
</p>

<p>
"Please do not talk to me about art, dear lady; I
could not bear it from you," replied the artist.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I should thereby discover that you knew
nothing at all about it; and the one rag of faith still
wrapped round my jaded spirit is my belief in your
omniscience.  If you take that away from me I shall sink
lower and lower, and shall probably end in doubting the
wisdom of Woman, or the supremacy of the British
rate-payer."
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor laughed.  "Don't you feel like this when
I talk about politics?"
</p>

<p>
"Far from it.  I know absolutely nothing about them
myself; and when I hear you speaking familiarly&mdash;nay,
even flippantly&mdash;of Whips and Under Secretaries and
similar ruling powers, I regard you with awe as a mighty
sibyl juggling with the mysterious forces of the Unknown."
</p>

<p>
"I see; it must sound rather impressive."
</p>

<p>
"Impressive is not the word&mdash;it sounds simply
tremendous.  Calling Under Secretaries by their Christian
names seems to me like patting a thunderstorm or playing
with an earthquake; yet I have often heard you do it
without an apparent qualm.  It is marvellous!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor was very proud of what she considered
her wire-pulling powers; therefore she enjoyed the
Academician's persiflage.  It was in cases like this that
Madderley showed himself such a clever man; he always said
disagreeable things; but he generally took care that they
were the sort of disagreeable things that people wanted
him to say.  Women liked Mr. Madderley because, they
said, he did not flatter them; they never found out that
is was because he flattered them that they liked him so
much.
</p>

<p>
"When I talk about art, however, you regard me as
'an unlessoned girl,' I suppose," suggested her ladyship.
</p>

<p>
"That certainly is my idea, but, had you given me
time, I would have decked its crudeness with some
flowers of speech."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad that I did not give you time, then.
It would be insufferable if you began to be pleasant!
Your <i>raison d'Ãªtre</i> would be gone if you left off telling
disagreeable truths, and we should all leave off liking
you."
</p>

<p>
The artist smiled.  "It is very kind of you to say that,
Lady Eleanor; but don't you think that the men who
tell palatable fibs are really the popular men?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," Lady Eleanor hastened to assure him;
"now you are immensely popular&mdash;you must know that
you are; and yet you always say straight out whatever
you think, and never mind how disagreeable it is.  It is
this truthfulness that makes us all admire and trust you."
</p>

<p>
The artist smiled again.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember," continued Lady Eleanor, "how
you once told a whole group of us our faults at a party
at the Farleys'?  You said that I was ambitious, and
that Lady Farley was cruel, and that Isabel was shallow,
and that Violet was cold.  I have never forgotten it; I
thought it was so nice and plucky of you to tell us the
truth straight out like that."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Madderley remembered that he had once said
these things; he also remembered that he had never
thought any of them, but this he did not consider it
necessary to confess.
</p>

<p>
"But where are the politics you said you were going
to talk to me about?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  of course&mdash;I forgot.  I want to ask your
opinion as to the way in which the Government has
treated me.  You know Harry Mortimer was Lord
Kesterton's understudy&mdash;no, I mean Under Secretary&mdash;at
the War Office; and it was a very comfortable
arrangement for both of them."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Then Lord Kesterton took his own peerage without
a single twinge of conscience.  But now that poor, dear
Harry has succeeded to his uncle, and become Lord
Gravesend, he has got to be sent away like an inefficient
footman, because they say they cannot both of them be
in the House of Lords.  So please tell your host that
you think he has behaved abominably!"
</p>

<p>
"I do indeed.  Such conduct seems to me unjustifiable.
It is like drinking oneself, and insisting on one's
servants being teetotalers."
</p>

<p>
Lord Kesterton laughed.  Madderley always amused
him, and he loved to be amused.  "But you are keeping
back part of the truth, Lady Eleanor," he said; "we have
endeavoured to break the blow to Gravesend by giving
him the Governorship of New North Wales."
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor sighed.  "That is nothing.  I wanted
Harry to have a career."
</p>

<p>
"You forget that he is going to marry you," replied
her host; "surely that is a career sufficient to satisfy even
the most ambitious of men, and to occupy the time of
the most industrious."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is.  What I ought to have said was that
I wanted Harry to have a recreation."
</p>

<p>
"Recreation means variety of occupation," suggested
Lord Kesterton, "and he would hardly find that&mdash;after
marriage&mdash;at the War Office."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he will find it in New North Wales?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly; because there, in his official life, his
duty will be to rule."
</p>

<p>
"You are very rude," laughed Lady Eleanor; "I shall
talk to Mr. Madderley instead, and ask him if he doesn't
think that Gravesend is a very depressing title for a young
man to come into."
</p>

<p>
"It suggests the quintessence of finality," replied the
artist, "there is no doubt of that."
</p>

<p>
Lord Gravesend's <i>fiancÃ©e</i> nodded.  "I mean to alter
it, and to call him 'the Lord Harry' instead.  That would
be prettier, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Far prettier; also more colloquial, and I love
colloquialisms.  They are the next best thing to stories in
dialect.  A story in dialect invariably does me good,
because I do not understand it."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you think that it is the things we don't
understand that do us good?" queried the lady.
</p>

<p>
"Of course; that is why our prescriptions are always
written in Latin, and our menus in French."
</p>

<p>
"I see."
</p>

<p>
"When I read in the vulgar tongue," continued Mr.
Madderley, "that a man is brave and a woman is beautiful,
I am not impressed.  I have met brave men in the flesh,
and I have found that they generally talk about nothing
but slain beasts, and go to sleep after dinner.  I have also
met beautiful women."
</p>

<p>
"Did you find them equally disappointing?" asked
Lady Eleanor.
</p>

<p>
"A woman always seems to think that if she has a
face she need not possess a head as well.  Personally I
prefer both."
</p>

<p>
"You are shockingly cynical!"
</p>

<p>
"Here the power of dialect comes in," continued the
artist, "for when I read that a man is 'braw' and a woman
is 'bonny,' I know no wells of experience from which to
draw cold water to throw on these illusions; therefore my
imagination runs riot, and clothes the parties thus
described in impossibly perfect attributes.  I never met a
'braw lad' or a 'bonny lassie' in my life, that I know
of; so I still picture such beings as ideal and glorious
creations."
</p>

<p>
After a little more conversation about airy nothings,
Lady Eleanor turned to her host and asked in a low
voice: "Who is going to take Harry's place at the War
Office?"
</p>

<p>
The Secretary of State raised his eyebrows.  "I really
cannot tell you Cabinet secrets, my dear lady."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  yes, you can.  I want dreadfully to know, and
I will promise faithfully not to tell anybody, if only you
will take me into your confidence.  Please do, there's a
dear man!"
</p>

<p>
Lord Kesterton hesitated.  Lady Eleanor certainly
was very attractive, and it is always pleasant to please
a pretty woman.  Seeing him hesitate, she increased
her coaxing tenfold.
</p>

<p>
"Well, suppose that I tell you as a great secret," he
said at last, "will you give me your word not to repeat it
to anybody?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will.  I should never think of doing such
a thing."
</p>

<p>
Lord Kesterton lowered his voice to a confidential
pitch.  "The new Under Secretary for War is our
honourable friend the member for Chayford."
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor's eyes sparkled with delight; it was her
<i>rÃ´le</i> to stand behind the scenes of Governments and to
give little jerks to the ropes&mdash;at least, she thought it was;
and now both her curiosity and her love of power were
gratified.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad!" she exclaimed, "he is such a pleasant
man&mdash;and very clever too, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
Like all women, Lady Eleanor Gregory considered
the word clever was complimentary; like all men, Lord
Kesterton considered it quite the reverse.
</p>

<p>
"Clever?" he replied, "my dear young lady, what a
word to apply to a brilliant politician I Why, he is already
one of the ablest men in the Liberal party, and he has
only been in the House three years."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad you told me.  It will interest Harry
most tremendously!"
</p>

<p>
Lord Kesterton started.  "But you gave me your
word that you would not tell anybody."
</p>

<p>
"So I did; I quite forgot.  But Harry doesn't count,
you know.  I never keep anything from him&mdash;except, of
course, the number of dances that I give to other men;
but that is different."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot see why Gravesend doesn't count; he
always appears to me to be a man of considerable weight."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but you are not engaged to him; if you
were you would know that his considerable weight
could be tampered with by the display of a little tact and
persuasion.  But now tell me more about Harry's
successor.  Of course I know all about who he is to-day;
but who was he yesterday?  I want to read up the back
numbers of his story."
</p>

<p>
The host shook his head.  "Back numbers are always
dull and generally fictitious, I find."
</p>

<p>
"I don't; they amuse me immensely&mdash;especially
with portraits from early and hideous childhood up to
'present day'."
</p>

<p>
"Lady Eleanor," said the Secretary for War in a
very low voice, "do you know why you have been
successful in extracting this confidential communication
from me?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Guess."
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor thought for a moment.  "Because you
knew you could trust me not to repeat it?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Kesterton smiled.  "That was not exactly my
reason.  Try again."
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor knitted her pretty forehead.  "Because
you thought that Harry had the right to know who was
to step into his shoes?"
</p>

<p>
Her host shook his head.
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor smiled.  "Because I am a very charming
young woman?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not deny that that had something to do with
my breach of confidence; but there was still another and
a better reason."
</p>

<p>
"Then I cannot guess it."
</p>

<p>
"Will you give it up?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Eleanor nodded,
</p>

<p>
"I ventured to tell you this State secret," whispered
Lord Kesterton to his pretty guest, "because the fact
is already announced in the evening papers."

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
Childish Things.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  As fays and elves and witches old<br>
  To children of a gentler mould,<br>
  Angels and devils came their way<br>
  And were adapted to their play.<br>
</p>

<p>
A quaint old town which had long ago ceased
to be anything but picturesque, but which never
forgot that it had once been prosperous, as
some women never forget that they have once
been pretty&mdash;a town in which the square, red-brick
houses pretended that they were frowning on the streets
in front, while they were really smiling on the gardens
at the back all the time&mdash;a town with an interesting
past and a most uneventful present&mdash;such was Chayford
in the county of Mershire.
</p>

<p>
A noticeable figure in the town of Chayford&mdash;a man
of courtly manners, cultivated mind and consistent piety&mdash;a
scholar, moreover, of no mean order, whose learning
was profound and whose wisdom was not of this world&mdash;such
was Mark Seaton, a minister "of the people called
Methodists".
</p>

<p>
In the days of his youth the Reverend Mark Seaton
had chosen as his wife Ruth, the only daughter of David
Crayshaw of Camchester&mdash;well known among the Methodists
of the past generation as a "leading friend";  and
Mrs. Seaton had inherited a fortune from her father, in
addition to many gifts of mind and person.  As she had
been a dutiful daughter, so she was a devoted wife.  To
her children she was ever sympathetic and tender, with
intermittent attacks of discipline, which she disliked as
much as they did; and while her heart was ever begging
her to indulge, her conscience kept bidding her to punish
them.  She had been known to whip her darlings, urged
by a painful sense of duty thereto; but on such sad
occasions she wore a shawl for the rest of the day, just
as she did when the minister was not well, or when any
important member of the congregation died.
</p>

<p>
Mark and Ruth Seaton had only two children, Paul
and Joanna by name.  Joanna was the elder by a year;
but Paul was so much the bigger and stronger and
better-looking of the two, that he took the lead in everything.
</p>

<p>
Paul and Joanna Seaton were brought up in the good
old Methodist style, and learned to take life seriously.
To them every trivial choice was a decision between
good and evil&mdash;every fortunate accident a special
interposition of Providence on their behalf.  They were early
taught by their father that the only two things of
importance in this life are salvation and education;
likewise, that the verb To Be is of infinite moment&mdash;the
verb To Do of great weight&mdash;and the verb To Have of
no significance at all.  Therefore, whatever faults and
failings they might suffer from in after life, there was no
possibility of the little Seatons becoming vulgar.
</p>

<p>
It was when the Seatons "travelled" in the Chayford
circuit that Paul and Joanna formed their friendship with
Alice Martin.  Alice was three years younger than Joanna
and two years younger than Paul.  It was true that she
was not as clever as Joanna&mdash;but then she was much
prettier, which made it all right.  And in childish days&mdash;as
in later ones&mdash;Alice Martin was always ready to play
inferior parts in a grateful spirit; a habit of mind which
makes people to be beloved, if downtrodden, by their
fellow-creatures.
</p>

<p>
Alice's parents were wealthy and worldly persons.
Of being the former they were proud, and of being the
latter they were ignorant; in fact they imagined that
they were a very godly couple, because they attended
chapel regularly, and had their library lined with
calf-bound copies of the <i>Methodist Magazine</i>, dating from its
Arminian days.  Mr. and Mrs. Martin regarded religion
very much as they regarded an "English manufacture"
or an "Irish industry"; that is to say, they lost no
opportunity of patronizing and advertizing it; but felt that
in so doing they were conferring a favour and meriting a
vote of thanks.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin was an extremely amusing woman; but
she herself had no idea of this&mdash;she imagined she was
only dignified and edifying.  She once said: "Although
my husband is a rich man and a county magistrate, he
has the fear of the Lord before his eyes".  And she had
no idea that there was anything humorous in this use of
the conjunction although.
</p>

<p>
Another great friend of the minister's children was
Edgar Ford&mdash;an earnest little boy who was always asking
profound and unanswerable questions.  His father was
an opulent merchant; and his mother an elegant and
well-bred woman, who hid great kindness of heart under
a somewhat cold and stately exterior.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the most important figure in the children's
world&mdash;while they were yet children&mdash;was their
old nurse Martha, a very superior and excellent person
who had lived with Mrs. Seaton before her marriage.
Martha had another servant under her; but she would
share with no one the delightful duty of looking after
Paul and Joanna.  It was Martha who corrected their
childish sins and comforted their childish sorrows; and
it was Martha who placed them upon an intimate, yet
withal comfortable, footing with the principalities and
powers of the spiritual world.  To Martha they owed
their ineradicable belief that an inclination to idleness
or disobedience or greediness was no mere instinct, but
a suggestion of the Evil One himself, who&mdash;bat-winged
and cloven-footed, as he appeared in the illustrations to
the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>&mdash;lurked in the dark places of the
china-pantry and the back-stairs, for the set purpose of
betraying to destruction the souls of the minister's
children.  Likewise, they were taught that the subdual
of this inclination was no mere outcome of a line of
plain-living, high-thinking ancestors, but a triumph of
the powers of light over the powers of darkness.  These
beliefs Paul and Joanna never outgrew; which, perhaps,
accounted for the fact that, as man and woman, they
did not underestimate the difference between good and
evil.
</p>

<p>
At Chayford Paul and Joanna spent three of the
interminable years of childhood; and Chayford Chapel was
ever afterwards associated in their minds with all that is
sacred and holy.  It was there that they had first touched
the fringe of the Unseen, and caught glimpses of life's
deeper meanings; it was there that they had sung the
old-fashioned hymns to the old-fashioned tunes, and had
felt as if they themselves were somehow one with the
white-robed multitude, which no man can number, singing
the song that the angels cannot learn.  Then the hearts
of the children were filled with joy and their eyes with
tears, and a strange thrill ran through the whole of their
being.  They did not understand why they felt so
gloriously happy and yet wanted to cry; for they were then
too young to know that earth, and probably heaven, has
nothing better to offer us than that same thrill, which
runs through us when we catch fleeting glimpses of the
Beautiful and the True, and rise superior for the time
being to all that is sordid and cowardly and mean.  For
the moment, we are "pure in heart"; and therefore,
either through the interpretation of art or the revelation
of nature, either in the loyalty of a great people or in the
love on a familiar face, we "see God".
</p>

<p>
When Paul and Joanna were respectively eighteen
and nineteen, their father's health gave way and he was
obliged to "sit down"&mdash;a synonym among Methodist
ministers for retiring upon half-pay&mdash;and he chose
Chayford as the spot where he would finally settle.  The
Seatons had spent their three years at Chayford some
time previously; and it had suited them so well that
they selected it as their permanent abode.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that the Methodist system of
having a sort of "general post" among the ministry
every Conference keeps the Church together in a most
successful way; but there is also no doubt that a triennial
removal falls heavily on the women of the ministers'
households.  No Wesleyan minister can stay longer than
three years in any circuit; and he need only stay one;
so, like the Mohammedans and their Hegira, all his race
reckons time by "Conference".
</p>

<p>
There was a nomadic strain in Joanna's blood,
inherited from three generations of preaching ancestry;
and she was incapable of feeling happy under any
roof-tree for a longer period than three years.  But her
mother was of a less restless disposition; and had learnt
that if one is continually moving one's Lares and
Penates, these idols are apt to get very much the worse
for wear, if not actually broken to pieces.  It is only
when a Wesleyan minister "sits down," that his family
are able to thoroughly understand the meaning of
the word home.  Therefore Mrs. Seaton rejoiced in
secret over her house at Chayford.  Her husband's
health was not such as to give her any real anxiety, but
he was growing too old for full work, and needed rest;
and the fortune that she had brought to him made him
feel that he was justified in taking, with a clear
conscience, the repose for which he craved.
</p>

<p>
Paul was doing very well at Kingswood School; and
Joanna was doing equally well in the school of domestic
life; and their parents' cup of joy was full when at last
Paul won a scholarship at Oxford.
</p>

<p>
On the morning when Paul's triumph had been made
known at home, Mrs. Seaton went into the kitchen after
breakfast to break the glad news to Martha.  But the
latter met her with a most ominous expression of
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"There's a sad thing happened this morning, ma'am,
and no mistake," she began, with a profound sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Martha, and what is that?" inquired her mistress.
</p>

<p>
"The best hot-water jug has gone to its long home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Martha, not the Ruth and Naomi one?"
</p>

<p>
"The very same, ma'am, more's the pity!"
</p>

<p>
Now it happened that this hot-water jug was one of
Mrs. Seaton's most cherished household gods.  It
portrayed the first chapter of the Book of Ruth.  Ruth and
Naomi clave to each other under the shadow of the spout,
while Orpah returned to her own people in the direction
of the handle.  The handle itself was one gigantic ear of
barley; and on the opposite side of it to that where Orpah
and her people evidently dwelt, Boaz reaped with his
young men, neatly dressed as English farm-labourers.
</p>

<p>
"How ever did it happen?" asked Mrs. Seaton in a
reproachful tone.
</p>

<p>
"I was just carrying it with the breakfast cups across
the kitchen, and suddenly it smashed itself to bits on
the floor."
</p>

<p>
"But, Martha, I have so often told you not to try to
carry so many things at once.  It was sure to end in an
accident."
</p>

<p>
"So you have, ma'am; but it seemed as if it was to be."
</p>

<p>
"It would not have happened if you had done as I
told you," said Mrs. Seaton quite sternly.
</p>

<p>
"That is true, ma'am; but it seemed as if it was to be."
</p>

<p>
Nothing that her mistress said could convince Martha
that she was in any way to blame in the matter.  She
seemed to regard herself as merely the instrument in a
foreordained scheme of destruction; and kept repeating in
a tone of grim satisfaction, "it seemed as if it was to be!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton had learned many things in life; and one
of them was that feminine argument is always unattractive
and generally useless.  She was a woman of infinite
tact, and took great pains never to hurt people, or even
to make them uncomfortable.  Her instinct told her
what places were sore to the touch; and her religion
prevented her from touching the same.  She was too good
a woman to rejoice secretly at other people's misfortunes,
and too clever a one openly to pity them.  But all this
did not come by nature to Mrs. Seaton; it had taken
half a lifetime's experience&mdash;and also considerable
knowledge&mdash;to bring her tact to this state of perfection.
</p>

<p>
On the present occasion she changed the subject by
saying: "We have had good news about Master Paul
this morning, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, ma'am, that is a good hearing!  What has
come to the dear lad?"
</p>

<p>
"He has won a scholarship at Oxford, and so is going
to the University."
</p>

<p>
"Well, ma'am, that is good news and no mistake!
Oxford is a fine place, I hear; and I am told that there's
a chapel belonging to each of the colleges, so that the
dear young gentleman will not be cut off from the means
of grace."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton smiled.  "The college chapels are not
Methodist chapels, however."
</p>

<p>
"Are they not, ma'am?  Well, that's a pity!  I
thought they were.  Still any sort of a chapel is better
than a church, to my thinking."
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Seaton listened with much amusement
while Martha further expounded her views on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
So Paul Seaton went to Oxford, and drank deep into
the spirit of a city whose very lawns have to be rolled for
five hundred years before they are considered soft enough
to walk upon.  And there Paul saw visions and dreamed
dreams; and because he had been vouchsafed two
of the best gifts wherewith Providence can equip a
man&mdash;namely a religious training and a sense of
humour&mdash;his dreams were never ignoble and his visions never
absurd.  He made up his mind to serve God and his
generation to the best of his ability, and to make for
himself a great name into the bargain; for he was as
yet young enough to concoct plans for the conflagration
of the river Thames; not knowing that if a man can
kindle a fire on his own hearthstone to keep him warm
in his old age, he has done his share towards the
heating-apparatus of this world, and can count himself among
the more successful half of mankind.
</p>

<p>
Paul also grew lean and tall and vigorous; and was
very pleasant to look upon, with his dark hair, grey eyes
and well-cut face.  He was not a handsome man, strictly
speaking; but, as Martha said, "he would pass in a
crowd," and he was quite good-looking enough for
everyday use.
</p>

<p>
The years had not dealt quite as kindly with Joanna
as with Paul.  She was short and thin and colourless;
one of those whitey-brown-threads of women who are
constantly being overlooked by their friends and
neighbours, and whose natural abode is supposed to be the
outlying districts of other people's lives.  And she took
no pains to make herself attractive, as a vainer girl
would have done; for she was as yet young enough to
cherish that admirable and false belief that folks love
us according to our excellencies.  We all begin life well
grounded in this groundless faith, and we rejoice in it as
long as we are youthful enough to fancy that our
excellencies will be many; but as we grow older and see
how few of these there be, and those not of the finest
water, we thank heaven for showing us that the
aforesaid dogma was nothing but the rankest heresy.
</p>

<p>
Joanna was the raw material out of which nuns and
sisters of mercy are made.  Had she belonged to a
different faith and a different age, she would have
developed into a model lady-abbess.  To her, love was a
matter of no interest; it formed no part of the
programme of life.  Such romance as her nature possessed
had been lavished upon Mrs. Crozier, the wife of one
of the ministers in her father's penultimate circuit.  No
lover ever adored his mistress, and no devotee his saint,
more absorbingly than Joanna adored Mrs. Crozier.
</p>

<p>
There is always something pathetic in the adoration
of a young girl for an older woman; she gives so much,
and can, of necessity, receive so little; yet, with the
exception of motherhood, it is perhaps the most unselfish
affection which a woman's life can hold.  The girl
worships with her whole heart, and pours out all the early
romance of her nature on this particular shrine; and
the woman either suffers this devotion patiently, or
snubs it cruelly&mdash;according as she happens to be
amiable or the reverse.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Crozier was kind to Joanna on the whole; but
she had not much time to waste on girls, for she was a
busy woman.
</p>

<p>
There are some people who go through life putting
all their eggs into one basket.  There are others who
avoid this mistake, but fall into the equally unlucky one
of putting their eggs into baskets which are already full.
These erring mortals pour out the treasures of their
love at the feet of those whose coffers are overflowing,
and spend their days in the thankless task of waiting
upon such as are well served.  Joanna Seaton was one
of these.  It was her fate in life to give love where she
could only receive friendship, and friendship where she
could only receive toleration.  Had she given otherwise
and otherwhere, her rewards might have been different.
But what man or woman can bestow their affection as
their wisdom prompts?
</p>

<p>
Therefore there was a tragic element in Joanna's
lot.  But when "gorgeous Tragedy" puts off her "sceptred
pall" and dresses like a dowdy little spinster, men
are too blind to recognize and too hard to pity her.  So
she bears her burden in silence.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean to do when you leave Oxford?"
asked Joanna of Paul one day.
</p>

<p>
"I shall take a First and go to the Bar, and then into
Parliament," replied her brother promptly.  Paul always
knew his own mind&mdash;a branch of knowledge which is
useful in this world.
</p>

<p>
"But suppose you fail?" suggested Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not fail."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I have made up my mind not to fail, but
to work at a thing till I succeed.  When a man is a
failure it is always his own fault."
</p>

<p>
"Except when it is God's; and then failure is better
than success," said Joanna quietly, who knew more about
failure&mdash;and therefore more about success&mdash;than Paul did.
</p>

<p>
He had still to learn that the man who tries and
succeeds is one degree less of a hero than the man who
fails and yet goes on trying.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Martin did not at all approve of Paul Seaton's
going to Oxford: nominally, because he upheld that
learning was a dangerous thing for a young man who
had his own living to get; and actually, because he could
not bear any one else to enjoy such advantages of mind,
body or estate as had not been vouchsafed, in still
fuller measure, to himself.  He therefore spoke a word
of warning to the young man one day when Paul happened
to be calling at The Cedars.
</p>

<p>
(The Martins' house was called The Cedars because
there happened to be a yew-tree in the middle of the
lawn.)
</p>

<p>
"My dear Paul," Mr. Martin began, "I trust that
the purely intellectual life in which you are now
indulging will in no way unfit you for earning your own
living in a suitable and becoming way; nor, on the other
hand, lead you into infidelity."
</p>

<p>
Paul likewise hoped not, and said so.
</p>

<p>
"To my mind," interpolated Mrs. Martin, "there are
few more delusive snares than learning, falsely so called."
</p>

<p>
This excellent lady had no taste for art or literature,
and consequently she considered them wrong.  It is so
easy&mdash;and pleasant&mdash;to discover sins lurking in the
pursuits for which we are not inclined.  Many of us possess
wonderful powers of perception in this matter.
</p>

<p>
"My fear always is that classics and mathematics
and rubbish of that kind will disable a man for the more
serious business of life," continued Mr. Martin, "and
render him incapable of making and earning money."
</p>

<p>
"But don't you think that they might rather enable
a man to earn his own living?" suggested Paul.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Martin shook his head.  "Such things might
enable him to earn his own living, perhaps, but never to
make a fortune."
</p>

<p>
"Is it absolutely necessary to human happiness to
make a fortune, I wonder?" queried Paul.
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Martin was a very good-tempered man, and
the causes of his amiable attitude of mind were two-fold&mdash;he
was very well-off and he was always sure he was in
the right; so he had no grounds for a quarrel with
anybody.  But when people spoke slightingly of the good
things of this world, he was much shocked: he called it
"tempting Providence".
</p>

<p>
"Wealth is the hall-mark of success," he replied
rather shortly, "and poverty is the outward and visible
sign of failure."
</p>

<p>
"I can hardly agree with you there, Mr. Martin.
Who ever thinks about how much money Shakespeare
or Milton made?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Martin regarded this remark as childish, so took
no notice of it, but calmly continued: "I once knew a
man who began life as an errand-boy; and yet when he
died he left half a million of money behind him.  Now
that is what I call success."
</p>

<p>
"And I once knew of a man who began life as a free-born
citizen of no mean city, and was executed as a
prisoner at Rome; and who left no fortune behind him
save a few letters.  Yet the world hardly calls that man
a failure."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think it is a little irreverent to apply
things out of the Bible to every-day life?" suggested
Mrs. Martin in a reproachful tone.  "It always grates
upon my ear when I hear young people do it."
</p>

<p>
"It never struck me in that light."
</p>

<p>
"I fear," added the master of The Cedars, "that too
much learning is already leading you into infidelity, and
causing you to speak flippantly of sacred matters.  As I
said before, I cannot commend useless study.  In my
opinion, if a man has any time to spare from his
business he should devote it to religion."
</p>

<p>
"As you have done, Caleb," remarked his appreciative
spouse.
</p>

<p>
"I have always endeavoured to do so, my dear; and
that, I take it, is the reason why my investments are
almost invariably successful."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Martin was one of the men who act up to their
convictions.  Early in life he had undertaken the difficult
task of combining the service of God and Mammon.  For
some ten hours a day he worked hard at making and
amassing money; but his "off-time" he devoted
conscientiously to heaven; and he considered that, on
the whole, heaven had nothing to complain of in the
arrangement.
</p>

<p>
It is but fair to add that Caleb Martin endeavoured,
according to his lights, to do his duty to both the powers
under whom he served; but, if the two interests did happen
to clash, it was never Mammon that came short.  Otherwise,
perhaps, he would not have been such a rich man.
</p>

<p>
"My husband has never cared for pleasure," continued
Mrs. Martin, "and many a time when I considered that
a little relaxation would be good for him, he has said to
me, 'My religion is my recreation, Sarah'.  And he has
always made it so."
</p>

<p>
"I have indeed," replied Mr. Martin modestly;
"though I do not think, my dear, that you should thus
proclaim my virtues upon the house-top.  It may seem
just a little boastful to one not of our own household."
</p>

<p>
Both Mr. and Mrs. Martin considered that the latter's
description of her husband was unadulterated praise.  It
never occurred to either of them that any one in heaven
or on earth would not consider it as such.  It also never
occurred to them that they were being at all humorous.
</p>

<p>
"You have certainly succeeded even beyond your deserts,
Mr. Martin," remarked Paul with much sincerity.
</p>

<p>
The excellent Caleb waved his hand in a deprecatory
manner.  "I have received my penny a day," he replied;
"neither more nor less."
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact he was at that moment receiving
about nineteen pounds, nineteen shillings and eleven
pence more than his penny a day; but it never does to
press a metaphor too far.
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Martin chimed in with the remark: "You
will do well to think upon Mr. Martin's words, my dear
Paul.  At Oxford you are doubtless exposed to other
pernicious influences in addition to that of infidelity, as
you are thrown much with young persons who have been
nurtured in the pride of high rank and of noble blood&mdash;a
most subtle and dangerous form of sin, to my thinking."
</p>

<p>
Paul much regretted that Joanna was not present.
She always appreciated Mrs. Martin so warmly, and she
had frequently called attention to the fact (now <i>en
evidence</i>) that in the spiritual world the special dangers
which beset our neighbours seem so much more terrible
than those which beset ourselves.  The latter are but
pardonable weaknesses, we think; but the former are
mortal sins.  Thus we pray that we may be delivered
from pitfalls which have no attraction for us, and we
hope that Providence will be so much engaged in attending
to the fulfilment of this prayer, that our slips and
stumbles into the little hollows which we affect will pass
unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
"Pride of birth is a dreadful besetment," continued
Mrs. Martin, "and one which I pray may never be laid
to my charge."  Which certainly seemed an almost
superfluous petition, considering the lineage of the
suppliant.
</p>

<p>
The Martins were very anxious to be delivered from
the temptations arising from such mundane blessings as
had been denied them; but it never seemed to occur
to them to pray for exemption from the love of money.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose all worldly gifts become besetments if we
give them a primary instead of a secondary place,"
suggested Paul, "and if we confuse essentials with
non-essentials."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, quite so," agreed Mr. Martin; "and it is
this thought which gives us parents so much anxiety
when we look forward into our children's future&mdash;this
fear that the young people may, in their ignorance, fling
away the substance for the sake of the shadow; as a
young friend of mine once did, who refused a partnership
in an excellent business in order to become a missionary."
</p>

<p>
"What happened to him eventually?" asked Paul.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Martin heaved a sigh of sincere regret.  "He
died&mdash;a comparatively young man&mdash;somewhere in the
South Seas.  And if he had taken my advice and stayed
at home, he might have been the mayor of his native
town by this time.  But young folks will not be controlled."
</p>

<p>
"Still I can't help thinking that on the whole it is as
fine a thing to be a martyr as to be a mayor," Paul
remarked.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Martin considered this remark irreverent.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Martin is right," sighed the mistress of The
Cedars, "though for my part, I desire for my one ewe
lamb neither riches nor honour; I only ask that she may
be wise and happy."
</p>

<p>
And then the conversation was interrupted by the
entrance of Alice, who blushed very becomingly on
perceiving Paul; while Mrs. Martin&mdash;having noted the
blush&mdash;was straightway plunged into a very maelstrom of
maternal unrest, lest the one ewe lamb, for whom she
desired neither riches nor honour, should seek happiness
with the impecunious son of a minister of religion.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
Alice.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I will own you as my prince<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sight of heaven,<br>
  For I've loved you ever since<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was six or seven.<br>
</p>

<p>
In consequence of her daughter's incriminating blush,
Mrs. Martin set herself to the not uncommon task
of locking a stable door after the steed has been
stolen.  But it was too late.  Alice loved Paul
Seaton, and felt that to be with him and to hear his
voice was ideal happiness.  As for Paul, he liked his old
playmate because she thought him infallible and because
she was pleasant to look upon; but his time for love was
not yet.
</p>

<p>
Men and women approach the great subject of love
by such different roads.  The normal woman begins her
life by raising an altar to an unknown god, and dedicates
it to the first handsome stranger who comes her way, as
the niche over the shrine is generally what shop-keepers
call "stock size".  Worship is the leading motive of her
existence: the particular idol whom she happens to
adore is a mere matter of circumstance.
</p>

<p>
But with a man it is different.  In his case the goddess
appears prior to the altar; and it is only after he
has met and fallen down before the one, that he
recognizes the necessity of erecting the other.
</p>

<p>
Alice Martin was an extremely pretty girl; and reminded
one of a picture by Romney, with her soft brown
hair and eyes to match.  She was also sweet and good
and restful; and possessed the power of making happy
any man who happened to love her.  She also possessed
the power of loving almost any man&mdash;provided that he
was kind and agreeable, and always on the spot: for&mdash;let
poets and novelists say what they will in favour of
manly beauty and manly prowess&mdash;it is not the man of
war or the man of genius that carries the day with the
majority of women, but the man who happens to be on
the spot.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think Miss Alice is looking well; do you,
Martha?" asked Joanna of her faithful handmaid one day.
</p>

<p>
"Far from it, miss, far from it.  I passed the remark
only the other day to Mrs. Martin's cook, that Miss
Alice had just the same look that my niece Keren-happuch
Tozer had; and in three weeks after that, Keren-happuch
was a corpse," assented Martha cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
Joanna suppressed a smile.  "Oh!  I don't think she
is as bad as that, Martha; but she looks to me as if she
were fretting about something."
</p>

<p>
"May be she is, my dear.  The heart knoweth its
own bitterness, as Solomon said; and a wounded spirit
is as a broken tooth, as it were."
</p>

<p>
"I sometimes wonder if she is in love with Paul,"
remarked Paul's sister thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to be sure, miss, what an idea!  Yet Master
Paul is a likely enough lad for any maid to fancy, bless
his heart!"
</p>

<p>
"Falling in love seems a great bother, don't you think,
Martha?"
</p>

<p>
"I should just think it is, my dear, and no mistake.
I'm thankful to say I always kept clear of rubbish of that
kind.  I've had too much to do, what with preparing
your dear papa's meals, and keeping the circuit's furniture
in good order, to waste my time in thinking of men and
love and fallals of that sort."
</p>

<p>
"I have made up my mind that I shall never marry,"
said Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"And I, for one, don't blame you; for what with
throwing matches into the grates, and walking on the
carpets with muddy boots, and sitting on the antimacassars
and crumpling them up, there's nothing makes
as much dirt in a house as a man.  They are far worse
than dogs or children, in my opinion."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," mused Joanna, "I am not pretty enough to
get married."
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, my dear, that's neither here nor there!
If Providence ordains that you'll be married, married
you'll be, if you've got a face like a turnip and a figure
like a bolster.  As I once passed the remark to my sister
Eliza Ann&mdash;'Eliza Ann,' says I, 'you're the plainest
woman I ever set eyes on, and you've got the best
husband: which is nothing short of a miracle'."
</p>

<p>
Joanna smiled.  "Did not Eliza Ann feel hurt at
your saying that?"
</p>

<p>
"Not she: Eliza Ann was far too godly a woman to
care for such an earthly snare as beauty, or to spend her
days in plaiting her hair and putting on of apparel, like
the beasts that perish."
</p>

<p>
"Where is Eliza Ann now?" asked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"She went with her husband to Australia some years ago."
</p>

<p>
"Do you often hear from her?"
</p>

<p>
"Now and again, miss, when she has the time; but
what with one thing and another her days are pretty full.
She and her husband wanted me to go out and join them
at one time; but I said that unless they could promise
that I should sleep every night on land in a four-post bed,
I would not undertake the journey.  It may be all very
well to go travelling by day, when you can see where you
are going to; but travelling by night is only for such as
love darkness rather than light because their deeds are
evil."
</p>

<p>
Joanna Seaton had an admirable sense of humour;
and therefore always encouraged Martha when the latter
was inclined, like the moon, to take up her wondrous tale,
and relate the story of her earlier experiences.
</p>

<p>
"Your sister, Eliza Ann, must have been a woman
of strong character," said Joanna suggestively.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed she was, my dear, and no mistake.  She was
such a leading light in the Grampton circuit that it was
considered due to her piety to ask her to do the cutting-out
at the Dorcas-meeting.  But piety and cutting-out
don't always go together, more's the pity!"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they don't."
</p>

<p>
"Far from it.  There was once great distress in
Grampton, owing to bad trade coupled with a deep snow;
and Brother Phipson gave a roll of cloth to make clothes
for ragged little boys; Brother Phipson being a
cloth-merchant by nature and a circuit-steward by grace."
</p>

<p>
"It was very kind of him to give garments to the
poor," said Joanna approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"He was but an unprofitable servant, like the rest of
us," sighed Martha: "when we have done all we can,
our righteousness is but filthy rags hanging on barren
fig-trees."
</p>

<p>
"Did your sister cut out all the little boys' clothes?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it was in this way, miss.  Eliza Ann was such
a saint that it would not have been seemly for any other
member of the congregation to do the cutting-out while
she was present.  So she was appointed to the work.
But her mind was so full of the last Sunday evening's
sermon, that she cut out all the trousers for the same leg."
</p>

<p>
Joanna laughed outright.  "I suppose she was in a
great way when she found out what she had done."
</p>

<p>
"Not she, my dear," replied Martha, somewhat
reprovingly, "Eliza Ann was far too religious a woman to
own to anybody but her Maker that she had been in the
wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Then what did she do?"
</p>

<p>
"She said what she had done she had done for the
best, but it was always her fate to be misunderstood, so
she supposed she must take it as her cross and not
complain.  She had endeavoured not to let her left hand
know what her right hand was doing, and this was the
consequence.  Oh! she was terribly hurt, was Eliza
Ann&mdash;and no wonder!&mdash;when the young minister told her
that, according to his ideas, trousers (like opinions) should
not be one-sided.  It was so painful, she said, when men
reviled her and condemned her, after she had acted as she
thought for the best."
</p>

<p>
"What was the end of it all?" Joanna asked.
</p>

<p>
"The end was, miss, that Brother Phipson heard
what had happened, and gave another roll of cloth to
make the other legs; so that all things worked together
for good, and there was double the number of pairs that
there would have been if the cutting-out had not been
done by Eliza Ann."
</p>

<p>
"She really must have been a gifted person!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Eliza Ann was a godly woman, and no mistake,"
confessed Martha, with pardonable pride, "and
still is, I doubt not, a sea-voyage having no power to
change the human heart.  But she was none too easy
to get on with, when things were going smooth.  Though
I say it as shouldn't&mdash;being her sister&mdash;there were times
when Eliza Ann's religion was trying to the flesh of them
she had to do with."
</p>

<p>
"Did her husband think it so?" queried Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear, what a question to ask!  As if it
mattered what he thought!  Eliza Ann was far too sensible
to allow him to give his opinion about anything.  'If you
let a husband begin to pass remarks,' she used to say,
'it is the thin end of the wedge which in time will turn
again and rend you.'  So Eliza Ann avoided the first
appearance of evil."
</p>

<p>
"But she was really good, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Good, my dear?  Of course she was good!  Who
ever thought anything different?" exclaimed Martha,
who had never read Milton's line, "He for God only; she
for God in him," and would have called it "rubbish" if
she had.  "I assure you, miss, Eliza Ann was not one to
keep the outside of the cup and platter clean, while the
inside was filled with ravening wolves and dead men's
bones.  Though she might be aggravating, as it were,
in times of prosperity, in the day of adversity she never
failed nor fell short."
</p>

<p>
Joanna nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Now, in the case of Mr. Sweeting," continued
Martha, "him that so far forgot himself as to say that
trousers should be two-sided, you know.  As long as he
waxed fat and kicked, and was filled with pride and
vainglory, Eliza Ann would have nothing to say to him.
But when he fell sick of the small-pox, and there was
no woman to look after him&mdash;his mother being dead, and
his step-mother living at such a distance and caring
more for the things of this life than for her husband's
first family (which was all sons)&mdash;Eliza Ann went and
nursed him herself, and if it had not been for her the
poor young man would have died."
</p>

<p>
"Did she escape the infection?" asked Joanna anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Not she.  As soon as Mr. Sweeting was pretty well,
Eliza Ann caught the complaint and had a terrible
time.  And when she got well again she found her face
was disfigured, and her beautiful hair all cut off."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how sad!" cried Joanna.  "Was she pretty
before her illness?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear; far from it.  She was always a plain
woman at the best of times, but the small-pox left her
positively ugly.  She really had had beautiful hair; but
when it grew again it all came grey.  Perhaps her hair,
being her one beauty, might have proved a snare to her;
so the Lord saw fit to remove it, lest she herself&mdash;having
saved others&mdash;should become a castaway."
</p>

<p>
"Did she mind much when she found her face was so
disfigured?" Joanna asked: "and did she regret what
she had done?"
</p>

<p>
"Never once, miss.  Eliza Ann is not one of the
regretting sort.  She does what she thinks right, and leaves
Providence to take the consequences.  The first time I
saw her after her illness, 'My conscience alive, Eliza
Ann,' says I, 'you are a figure of fun!'  'Martha,' says
she, 'the Lord called me to nurse that poor, misguided
young man; and was I going to let the thought of my
vile body come between me and the Lord's work?'  That
was how Eliza Ann looked at the matter; and it was the
sensible view to my thinking."
</p>

<p>
Joanna's eyes filled with tears; self-sacrifice&mdash;even in
Eliza Anns&mdash;always touched her.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you said something comforting to your sister,
Martha."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, miss, I did, and something edifying too, I trust.
'Eliza Ann,' says I, 'if you have been ugly here, you will
be handsome enough in heaven, never fear.  Much beauty
you never had; but, such as it was, you gave it to the
Lord, and He will pay it back in His own good time!'"
</p>

<p>
"Then do you think that what we give up here will
be made up to us hereafter?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly so," replied Martha cheerfully: "the Lord
tells us in His Holy Word to owe no man anything; so
it isn't likely that He will remain in debt Himself.  Trust
Him, if we give Him our health or wealth or beauty, it
will be repaid, some thirty, some sixty, and some an
hundred-fold."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if we shall all be beautiful in heaven?" said
Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Of course we shall, my dear, if we want to be,"
replied Martha, "if the Lord lets us wish for anything
very much, He means to fulfil that wish, either in this
world or the next, or else He would never let us go on
wishing it."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you think that every one will be made good-looking
in heaven?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, Miss Joanna.  It will be a big job with some
of us, I admit; but the Lord will manage it, never fear."
</p>

<p>
"Still it seems wrong and selfish, somehow, to wish
very much for beauty," persisted Joanna, who, being
younger and less wise than her mother, was addicted to
argument.  "Mrs. Martin was talking about this the
other day, and she said she considered the mere desire
to be beautiful was a form of sinful vanity."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she is of a contented disposition, and has
brought her mind to her circumstances, as the saying is,"
suggested Martha, who always scented battle at the mere
mention of Mrs. Martin.  This excellent lady had a
wonderful knack of teaching people their place&mdash;a form
of education which does not add to the popularity of the
instructor.
</p>

<p>
"She said that wealth was a higher gift than beauty,"
continued Joanna thoughtfully, "because it could be used
for the benefit of others, while beauty was only a personal
possession; and she told me that she had often felt it
right to pray to the Lord for riches, because she needed
them to carry on His work."
</p>

<p>
"She never took Him in with that, I'll be bound,"
murmured Martha, with an ominous shake of the head;
"but it was just like her to try it on."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we ought not to mind whether we are
rich or poor, or handsome or plain," mused Joanna
aloud; "for this life is, after all, only an anteroom to
the next one.  Our happiness or unhappiness here is
really a question of no moment; what really matters is
whether we are using our happiness or unhappiness as a
fit preparation for the life to come."
</p>

<p>
"Quite true, my dear," commented Martha; "as
long as sick folk get well, it doesn't signify to them
whether they are cured by sweet syrups or by bitter
drugs.  It is the cure that matters, not the medicine."
</p>

<p>
Joanna nodded her head approvingly: Martha's
uncompromising sense of justice always appealed to her.
</p>

<p>
"Them as think too much of this present life and all
its vanities," continued Martha, "remind me of my poor
father, the first time he travelled by rail.  It was to see
his sister who lived at Folwich.  'Now, Joshua,' says
mother to him, 'whatever you do, don't sit down on
them comfortable seats and fall asleep, but remember
that you are a stranger and a sojourner.'  'All right,
missis,' says father; and then&mdash;like a man&mdash;did exactly
the opposite to what he'd been told.  Oh! they are
tiresome creatures, men are.  If you look after their
health, they say you are fussy; and if you don't, they
are all dead corpses.  Eh! but there is no peace for a
married woman, save in the grave; and not even there, I
doubt, unless he has been took first, and so she knows
he is out of harm's way."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't you think that men are able to take care
of themselves?" asked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"My conscience alive, miss!  You, who have got a
father of your own, to ask such a question as that!
Still there is some excuse for you, seeing that your father
is a minister, and so not quite like other men.  But even
a call to the ministry don't make a man equal to a
woman, to my thinking; though it is better than nothing,
as you may say."
</p>

<p>
"What happened to your father on his first journey?
That is what you were telling me."
</p>

<p>
"So I was, miss, so I was.  Well, as I was saying,
mother told father not to make himself too comfortable
on his journey, or worse would come of it.  She owned
afterwards that she had been foolish not to see that
forbidding a thing was just suggesting to him to do it,
and putting fresh mischief into his head; for the moment
she forgot she was speaking to a man, and treated him
as a reasonable being&mdash;which she ought to have known
better, being a married woman."
</p>

<p>
"Then did he disobey her?" inquired Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally, my dear, he did.  No sooner did father
start on his journey, out of reach of mother's eye, than
he sat down on them seats and went fast asleep, and he
didn't wake up again till he'd gone five stations past
Folwich."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!"
</p>

<p>
"It was 'oh dear!' and no mistake; for he had to
wait at Brayford four hours for the next train back, and
then had to come straight home again without seeing his
sister at all, besides having to pay the extra fare, which
came to five and threepence.  Mother said he was a type
of them that have their portion in this life, and are so
busy making the best of the wilderness that they pass
by the promised land without even seeing the name of
the station."
</p>

<p>
So Joanna and her old nurse&mdash;like the true Methodists
that they were&mdash;talked familiarly together about holy
things; and this familiarity arose not from any lightness
or irreverence, but from the fact that to them such
things were so near and so real that they became as
household words.
</p>

<p>
The Methodists of the past generation lived always
with their lamps lit and their loins girded, as those that
wait for their Lord; and they sought so diligently for
the True that they had no leisure to look for the
Beautiful, for it had not yet been revealed to them that the
True and the Beautiful are one.  They were so fearful
of confounding the substance with the shadow that they
did not altogether realize that the shadow is after all but
the reflection of the substance, and therefore a revelation
of the same; and they gazed so steadfastly into heaven
that they were in danger of forgetting how God made the
earth as well as the heavens and saw that it was good.
To their ears there was no message in the wind or the
earthquake or the fire; but they heard clearly the still
small Voice, and they did whatsoever it commanded them.
</p>

<p>
And we need not pity them overmuch that some of
the beauty and poetry of life was hid from their eyes.
They that seek first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness know no abiding lack; for all these things
shall be added unto them.
</p>

<p>
Now it happened that Martha was not the only person
who had noticed Alice's delicate appearance.  Alice's
mother had likewise perceived it, and it had struck a cold
chill to the maternal heart; for human nature is stronger
than worldly ambition or religious prejudice&mdash;is stronger
in fact than most things&mdash;and human nature has much
that is good in it, as well as much that is not quite so
good.  Therefore Mrs. Martin's comfortable view of
life&mdash;with an equally comfortable view of heaven in the
background&mdash;lost all its beauty and symmetry when her
careful eye perceived a tiny hollow appearing in Alice's
cheek.  Nevertheless the hollow remained, as "Paul
Seaton his mark," and Mrs. Martin was powerless to
remove it.
</p>

<p>
As for Paul himself, he was too much occupied with
books and boating and such important matters to notice
whether a girl's cheek were thin or the reverse; and he
would have been extremely surprised and annoyed to
learn that he possessed the right to excavate in so delicate
a field; for in his second year at Oxford he became
captain of his college boat, having proved his prowess on the
river; and he was happier then than he ever had been, or
probably ever would be again.
</p>

<p>
To Paul Seaton rowing was no mere pastime; at that
time it was to him a sign and type of all that was best in
life and human nature; and though in after years the
type changed, the thing which rowing then represented
was ever the greatest thing in the world to Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot understand how you can care so much
about an amusement," said Joanna one day, as she and
Paul and Alice were sitting in the garden at The Cedars.
</p>

<p>
Paul flushed.  "It isn't just an amusement; to me it
is a lot more than that."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how amusement can be anything more
than amusement," persisted Joanna.  "And to care too
much about a pastime seems to me as wrong as to care
too much about pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! can't you understand?" cried her brother.
"Can't you see that in boating, as in everything else
in life, there is considerably more than the thing itself?
Of course rowing is a glorious exercise, and a fellow
thoroughly enjoys it; but besides that, there is the <i>esprit
de corps</i>, and the desire to have one's boat first on the
river, and all that sort of thing, don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Alice.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you girls realize how awfully it matters
to a fellow that his college boat should be first.  Why,
I've seen men get soaked through, and yet forget all
about themselves, and not care a rap how cold and damp
they were&mdash;nor how ill they made themselves&mdash;as long
as their boat won."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Alice.
</p>

<p>
Now, as a matter of fact, Alice did not know one bit
better than Joanna did; but she used her eyes much and
her tongue little, and consequently had the reputation of
being an extremely sympathetic young person.  She had
a pretty way of looking interested and of saying, "Yes, I
know"; and women who do these things are beloved
both by their own sex and the other.  Alice was not
insincere in thus doing.  Her sympathy extended over a
far wider area than her comprehension; and her eyes
were truthful in the interest they expressed, though her
brain did not grasp the why and wherefore of this interest.
</p>

<p>
Alice felt more than she understood, and Joanna
understood more than she felt; consequently&mdash;and
deservedly&mdash;Alice won more love from her kind than Joanna
did; for the world is fair to people as a rule, and with
what measure they mete it is measured to them withal.
To a woman a heart is a more remunerative investment
than a head, and a much more satisfactory possession;
yet women are slow to perceive this.  If only the women
who have sufficient wit to say nasty things, had just so
much more wit as would prevent them from saying the
same, the world would be a pleasanter place, and the
men who have married stupid wives would have less
cause for self-congratulation than they have at present.
For in a woman&mdash;as in a lemon&mdash;bitterness is an
unpardonable defect; men, on the contrary&mdash;like
grouse&mdash;are all the nicer for a flavour of it.
</p>

<p>
"To me," remarked Joanna obstinately, "rowing is
merely a violent form of the 'bodily exercise' which
'profiteth little'; I cannot see anything else in it.  I
can understand that a man should want his own college
to produce the best scholars in the university; but I
cannot see how it can matter whether his boat is first
on the river or not."
</p>

<p>
Paul groaned.  "It is the firstness that matters,
don't you see? whether it applies to the schools or the
river."
</p>

<p>
"I see no credit in being first in mere physical
things," said Joanna, who was small and weak.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I do then," replied Paul, who was tall and
strong.
</p>

<p>
"I think it is nice to do things well, whether they
are physical or mental," added Alice, who was amiable.
</p>

<p>
"It is awfully jolly to feel you are in good form,"
replied Paul, pinching his biceps.
</p>

<p>
"I'd far rather be a genius than the strongest man
in the world," said his sister.
</p>

<p>
"Would you?" argued Paul.  "I can't say that I
would.  I'd rather have been Achilles in the thick of
the fight, than Homer writing about him.  Still success
in anything is a fine thing&mdash;about the finest thing in the
world, I suppose&mdash;and it must be glorious for a man to
feel himself a head and shoulders above his fellows in
any sphere!"
</p>

<p>
"You think too much about success," said Joanna
gravely; "the great thing, it seems to me, is to do one's
duty, and not bother about the results.  I can imagine
failure's being a better thing than success, under certain
circumstances."
</p>

<p>
Paul shrugged his shoulders.  "Well, I can't; and
at any rate I hope my portion in life will be the inferior
one you call success."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure it will be," added Alice, "you are so
awfully clever that there is no doubt that you will
succeed in whatever you undertake, just as you have
done in the boating."
</p>

<p>
"Which, as I said before, doesn't seem to me a sort
of success worth having," said the unbending Joanna.
</p>

<p>
Joanna laboured under a not uncommon delusion
that there is a special virtue in upholding any opinion
in the face of opposition; and that the oftener one
reiterates the opinion, and the more unacceptable it is,
the greater is the virtue.  To the masculine mind this
habit of thought is trying; and Paul found it specially
so when it ran right across his boyish enthusiasms.
Though he was as yet too young to know all that he had
learnt, the river had already taught him more than the
schools; it had shown him the necessity for self-imposed
discipline, implicit obedience, regular work, strong
endurance, stern self-denial and unity of aim and interest;
and even if he were unable as yet to realize all this&mdash;still
less to express it&mdash;Joanna's disapproval of his greatest
delight partook of the nature of sacrilege in Paul's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use talking to you of things which you don't
understand," he said crossly; Paul's temper&mdash;like canal
bridges&mdash;never being equal to bearing more than "the
ordinary traffic of the district".
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder that you enjoy rowing so much,
Paul, for it must be so nice on the river these lovely
afternoons," interpolated Alice, ever ready to make peace.
</p>

<p>
But Paul was not so easily appeased.  "Nice on the
river!" he grumbled, "what an expression!  Girls
never have an idea of anything better or higher than
what they call nice."
</p>

<p>
Which was very unjust, as well as very disagreeable;
for Joanna's visions of duty and Alice's dreams of love
were quite equal, from an ethical point of view, to Paul's
heroics; but of course Paul did not know this.  If he
had, he would have been thirty instead of twenty, and
wise at that.
</p>

<p>
"If I were a man I should love to be big and strong,"
persisted the peacemaker.  "It seems just as right for
a man to be strong as for a woman to be beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if beautiful women are much happier
than plain ones," remarked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Of course they are," replied Alice, "because people
love them more, and love is the only thing that really
makes a woman happy."
</p>

<p>
Joanna shook her head.  "I don't see that.  Your
own people will love you whether you are plain or
whether you are pretty; and it seems to me to have a
lot of outsiders fond of you would be a bother rather
than a pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"But don't you like people to be fond of you?" asked
Alice.
</p>

<p>
"Not unless I am fond of them.  When comparative
strangers kiss me and gush over me I feel so dreadfully
uncomfortable I don't know what to do.  There was a
very gushing woman in our last circuit who used to hold
my hand for hours together."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't have minded that," said Alice.
</p>

<p>
Joanna laughed.  "But I did: I was simply paralyzed
with terror; every time she gave my hand a squeeze, I
squeezed back; and if my squeeze hadn't been quite as
hard as hers, I felt as if I were in debt and ought to be
county-courted."
</p>

<p>
Paul was dreadfully bored by this style of conversation.
He was not sufficiently in love with Alice to care
to discuss emotions with her; for a man does not like to
talk about feelings, except to the woman he happens to
be in love with&mdash;and then he only does it to please her,
and wishes to goodness she would select some other
topic.
</p>

<p>
It was a very happy life at Chayford just then,
especially to Joanna.  Each day was full&mdash;but not too
full&mdash;of duties; and nearly every evening there was some
mild religious excitement to take the minister's family
out, and prevent life from ever seeming dull.  There were
the week-evening service and the class-meeting and the
prayer-meeting and the Dorcas-meeting&mdash;four full nights
for certain; and there often came little irregular and
extra means of grace for the other evenings of the
week; so that every day there was the pleasant feeling
that something was going to happen after tea.
</p>

<p>
This cheerful and busy type of existence exactly
suited Joanna; it satisfied her completely, and she had
no longings for anything different&mdash;neither much patience
with the people who had.
</p>

<p>
But Alice dreamed dreams of a fuller life, which was
not hers at all, but Paul's; a life devoted to adoring Paul
when he succeeded, and adoring him still more when he
failed.  She was content to stand afar off among the
crowd who were eager to crown Paul as victor in the
days of his triumph, if only she might have the right to
come near and comfort him in times of failure and
humiliation.  She fully believed that Paul was one of the
greatest men alive, and would prove himself such to the
world in general; but she would not have loved him a
whit less&mdash;but rather more&mdash;had she thought him
doomed to fail in everything that he undertook.  Paul
was Paul&mdash;that was enough for her; if the world did not
do him justice, so much the worse for the world.
</p>

<p>
As for Paul himself, he knew nothing of Alice's girlish
devotion to him, and would not have thanked her for
it if he had.  He meant to succeed; so the love that
beareth all things and never faileth, was not an article
for which he had any use.  The admiration that success
is bound to command was more in his line at present;
and that, of course, one demands as one's right, and
never thanks anybody for.  To Paul just then the love
that endures and is patient was as uninteresting as
chrysanthemums and china-asters would be in spring.
There comes a time when we cherish chrysanthemums
and china-asters&mdash;even of the most ordinary sort; but
that is not till the violets and the roses and the lilies are
all faded.

Two Kings in Brentford.

<p>
It has a very pretty effect in dancing the Lancers
when the dancers "set to corners";  but when our
hearts, and the affections thereof, take it upon
themselves to perform this particular figure, the
effect is not so satisfactory.  Yet it is a figure towards
the dancing of which these members much incline.
Therefore it happened that while Alice Martin was breaking
her heart for love of Paul Seaton, Edgar Ford was
breaking his for love of Alice Martin.
</p>

<p>
Surely Fate&mdash;when Fate is pleased to be ironical&mdash;displays
a most ingenious and whimsical sense of humour.
And it happened that Fate was just now sharpening this
particular sense at the expense of Mr. and Mrs. Martin.
This worthy couple generally liked things to be done at
their expense, it sounded so lavish and princely; but this
was carrying matters a little too far.
</p>

<p>
Paul, being poor, was anathema to Mr. and Mrs. Martin;
and Edgar, being rich, was their hearts' desire;
and yet Alice loved Paul and was indifferent to Edgar;
and in consequence there appeared that disturbing little
hollow in Alice's pretty cheek.
</p>

<p>
The Fords were the most important people in Chayford,
and had been rich merchants there for several
generations.  Edgar's great-grandfather was a friend of
John Wesley's; and the great little man had preached
the gospel under the huge cedar on the lawn of Chayford
House.  Consequently at Chayford Chapel the Fords
sat in the farthest-back pew, this being ever considered
the most august seat&mdash;the Woolsack in fact&mdash;of Methodist
chapels; and their place in the sanctuary was rendered
yet more glorious by a brazen fence, wherefrom
dangled a sort of short, red moreen petticoat, which ran
all along the top of their pew, and so screened the prayers
of the Ford family from the prying and plebeian eyes
of the rest of the congregation.  Mrs. Ford pronounced
the "Open Sesame" at all the Wesleyan bazaars and
sales-of-work within a radius of ten miles round
Chayford; and on such occasions she was specially
introduced to the divine notice by the officiating minister
under the pseudonym of "an handmaid".  As a child
Edgar had no idea what this expression exactly meant
(neither, perhaps, had the officiating minister), but he
felt extremely proud of his mother when he heard her
alluded to in this way; and when the minister's prayer
was more than usually embracing, and included Edgar
himself under the title of "her offspring," Edgar's
spiritual arrogance knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
If the Seatons were as the salt of Methodism, the Fords
were as the cream of it.  Their social position fitted them
for this life, and their religious fervour for the next.  They
neither hated the world as did Mark Seaton, nor
worshipped it as did Caleb Martin.  On the whole they very
fairly rendered to CÃ¦sar the things that were CÃ¦sar's, and
to God the things that were God's; and to do this, men
must know something about CÃ¦sar and also something
about God.
</p>

<p>
Edgar was now the only child of the house of Ford,
two little sisters having exchanged earth for heaven,
and taken their mother's heart along with them.  Like
all Nonconformists, Edgar Ford inclined to overscrupulousness
rather than to laxity.  He was ready to sacrifice
everything to his principles&mdash;which was right; but he
sometimes mistook his prejudices for his principles&mdash;which
was tiresome.  Looked at in the light of eternity, Edgar's
conduct was always eminently satisfactory; but looked
at in the light of earth, it was sometimes a little trying.  A
college friend of his once said that "Ford was suffering
from fatty degeneration of the conscience"; and Edgar's
conscience certainly was abnormally enlarged.  When
great issues were at stake, this extreme and sensitive
conscientiousness made Edgar Ford a prince among men;
but when one was dealing with less important matters,
and lawfulness was not so much the question to be
considered as expediency, Edgar's custom of hair-splitting was
somewhat paralyzing in its effects.  He would hardly let
himself do right for fear of doing wrong; which morbid
introspection was partly the result of a Puritan training
and ancestry, and partly of a delicate digestion.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, Edgar was "a proper man as one shall
see in a summer's day".  He was fair and slight and
good-looking; and the shyness and sensitiveness which
caused his own feelings to be so often hurt, made him
specially careful not to hurt other people's.  He did not
talk much; but always left one with the impression that
he had been extremely interesting, though one could not
recall a word that he had said.  His silence was more
interesting than most men's conversation; and his pride
less aggressive than most men's humility.  Yet he was
very silent and excessively proud.  For people in general
he cared not at all; he was too shy to understand and
too sensitive to defy them; but for the few for whom he
did care, his patience was exhaustless and his love unfailing;
nothing that they might do could estrange them from
him.
</p>

<p>
Martha once remarked, "When Master Edgar dies
of old age, Master Paul will shake in his shoes";  which
was her cheerful and picturesque way of notifying the
fact that Edgar was Paul's senior by only a few months.
Owing to this similarity of age and diversity of
temperament, a firm friendship had sprung up between the two
boys, which grew with their growth and strengthened
with their strength.
</p>

<p>
In every respect these two differed from each other.
While Paul knew neither shyness nor self-consciousness,
Edgar was a prey to both; while Paul took out his own
feelings and examined them and talked about them,
Edgar kept his shut up in the secret chambers of his
soul.  Paul was more sure of himself when he was in
the wrong than Edgar was when he was in the right;
and while Paul was inclined to ride rough-shod over
other people, Edgar was as tender as the tenderest
woman.  When Paul made up his mind to take a certain
path, he took it all the more determinedly if there were
lions in the way, and regarded the worsting of these
interfering beasts as the best part of the sport; but if
there were lions in Edgar's way, he hesitated about
taking that path at all&mdash;not because he was afraid of
lions, or of anything else under the sun save sin, but
because he regarded the presence of these "fearful
wild-fowl" as a divine intimation that such a path was not
for his treading.  Consequently Paul possessed the
elements of success, if by success one means fame and
wealth and the getting of one's own way; while Edgar's
was one of the natures foredoomed to failure, if by
failure one means nothing in this world but knowledge
of the truth, and in the world to come life everlasting.
Which are the common interpretations of the words
success and failure as used among men.
</p>

<p>
With all the intensity of a deep and refined and
somewhat narrow nature, Edgar Ford loved Alice.  He
did not inwardly examine himself to see the why and
wherefore of this love, as Paul would have done; he
merely knew that Alice Martin was all the world to him,
and would be so, as long as he and the world lasted.  It
was characteristic of the two men that Paul analyzed
his feelings, but took his motives for granted; while
Edgar carefully weighed and examined his principles, and
left his feelings to take care of themselves&mdash;knowing
that they were strong enough to do that, and a good
deal more into the bargain.  Edgar always knew what
he wanted, but not always what he ought to do; Paul,
on the contrary, always knew what he thought right, but
not always what he thought desirable.
</p>

<p>
Now if Edgar had been as wise as he was good, he
would have carried on his love-making regardless of
Paul, and would then and there have won Alice for
himself.  And that plan would have been the best for
everybody concerned; for Alice was not capable of holding
Paul, even if she could win him; and she was not the
woman to make Paul happy, even if he deluded himself
into fancying that he loved her; while Edgar was quite
equal to supplanting Paul in Alice's affection, and making
her and himself thereby happy ever after, if only he had
realized that "all is fair in love and war," and had set
about things in the right way.  But unfortunately it was
not Edgar's habit to set about things in the right way.
First, he reasoned with himself that Alice's happiness
was the great thing to be considered, and that Alice's
happiness was bound up in Paul; for poor Edgar's eye
had been as quick as Mrs. Martin's to discover that
telltale little hollow in Alice's cheek; and that therefore
his very love for Alice constrained him not to come
between her and the thing she coveted.  Then he further
decided that, as Paul's friend, he was in honour bound
not to stand in Paul's light, should Paul eventually
discover how extremely pretty Alice was.  And finally
he made up his mind to immolate himself upon the joint
altar of love and friendship; and it never occurred to
him that the flames of this sacrifice were likely to burn
up Paul and Alice's happiness as well as his own.
</p>

<p>
In Edgar's anxiety to leave Alice quite free, he strove
his utmost to hide from her the fact that he loved her;
he had an idea that in so doing he was taking the most
honourable course towards her and towards Paul.  And
he pursued this course with such success that Alice
thought him stuck-up and ill-tempered, and confided the
same to Paul, who&mdash;with more common sense and
equally little perception&mdash;decided that he was only bilious.
</p>

<p>
As for Paul, he had as yet no more idea that Edgar
cared for Alice than that Alice cared for himself.  Such
things were as yet unknown to him, though it was
gradually dawning upon him that Alice was extremely
good-looking and very easy to talk to.
</p>

<p>
But the rest of the world were not so blind as Paul;
and even Miss Drusilla Dallicot, the spinster <i>par
excellence</i> of Chayford, had some inkling as to how matters
stood.
</p>

<p>
Miss Drusilla's "mind to her a kingdom was," and
she prided herself upon the elegance of her diction and
the refinement of her style.  She was a very learned
little lady, and never used a word of one syllable it a
synonym of three could be found in the dictionary.  She
lived entirely in the literature of the past, and resolutely
refused&mdash;on any pretext whatever&mdash;to come down later
than the eighteenth century.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the kingdom of her mind, Miss Dallicot
ruled over a nice fortune of her own, and she gave freely
to "the cause" at Chayford.  She was extremely
particular in her habits; and while her godliness was
indisputable, her cleanliness was virulent.  No visitors
were allowed to enter her abode until they had been
rubbed down with a clothes-brush and a duster in the
back-hall; and even then they were rarely admitted into
the sanctum of her drawing-room, lest they should by
their presence soil the chintz covers therein.  What was
to be seen underneath those chintz covers was an
impenetrable secret.  It was rumoured in Chayford that
grass-green satin was the underlying texture, but this
was as purely traditional as the site of the Garden of
Eden, or the date of the building of Babel.  No living
man or woman had seen Miss Dallicot's drawing-room
furniture face to face.
</p>

<p>
"My dear young friend," said Miss Drusilla to Joanna
Seaton one day, when the minister's daughter was having
tea with her in her spotless dining-room; preparation for
the feast having been made by the spreading of a serviette
all over the visitor's lap, and of a small floorcloth under
the visitor's chair, lest an unwary crumb should escape
from its moorings and rush headlong on to the carpet:
"has it ever presented itself to your imagination that an
attachment of a sentimental character might possibly
arise between your gifted and talented brother and that
amiable young creature, Alice Martin?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe that Alice thinks Paul very clever, and I
know that Paul thinks Alice very pretty," replied Joanna
guardedly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is scarcely seemly of me to introduce
so romantic, though interesting, a subject to a person
as yet as youthful and innocent as yourself; yet my deep
reverence for my spiritual pastor, and my sincere attachment
to his attractive family, cause me to experience the
warmest concern in anything which affects either his
interest or theirs."
</p>

<p>
"It is very good of you, dear Miss Dallicot, to take so
friendly an interest in all of us; and your kind sympathy
is fully appreciated.  Father was saying only yesterday
that he counts you among his truest, as well as his
cleverest, friends; for he has never been disappointed
either in your heart or your head.  You know how he
enjoys a chat about books with you, and how much good
it does him."
</p>

<p>
"Your words, thus fitly spoken, are indeed as apples
of gold in pictures of silver.  The praise of so gifted a man
as your father is too high a tribute to such feeble powers
as I may possess; yet the suffrage of one who combines
the noble qualities of a true gentleman with the high
vocation of a minister of religion, is an encouragement to
any thoughtful mind to follow his guidance into the realms
of knowledge."
</p>

<p>
Now Joanna detested gossip above all things, having
already learnt that no good can come of it, but much
evil: so she wisely endeavoured to drive her hostess still
further into the realms of knowledge, so as to keep her
from inquisitively wandering into the fields of romance.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been reading anything new lately?" she
asked with much subtlety.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, my dear Joanna, new books and new writers
are alike abhorrent to my literary taste; and I dislike
the one as cordially as I despise the other.  To me my
Plato and my Aristotle are ever fresh; and if I desire to
provide my mind with suitable relaxation, are not Walter
Scott and Jane Austen ever at hand to plume my wings
for a flight into the world of fiction?"
</p>

<p>
"But don't you think that novels of all kinds&mdash;provided
of course that they are good ones&mdash;help one to
understand human nature?"
</p>

<p>
"You must first prove to me that a fuller understanding
of human nature is a 'consummation devoutly to
be wished'; for my own part I cannot see that it forms
a specially interesting or instructive branch of study.
That human nature is in but a sorry condition at present,
is my conviction: that it will some day rise to a height
unmeasured as yet, is my hope; but to watch it in its
dilatory and intermittent ascent&mdash;to count its countless
failures and to number its innumerable falls&mdash;is a pastime
which does not recommend itself to my intelligence, nor
render itself attractive to my fancy."
</p>

<p>
"Yet human nature is the most interesting thing and
the most important thing in the whole world&mdash;except
divine nature."
</p>

<p>
"To me, my dear Joanna, too lively an interest in
the thoughts and emotions of one's fellow-creatures
betokens a somewhat frivolous and unstable mind; and
would be in danger of gradually degenerating into a
gossiping habit, not becoming nor seemly in a professor
of the Christian religion."
</p>

<p>
Joanna looked thoughtful.  "Edgar Ford says that
Alice and I talk and think too much about feelings," she
said; "and that it is morbid and unhealthy of us."
</p>

<p>
"And doubtless, my dear child, there is some truth in
the statement; sufficient, at any rate, to warn you against
giving unbridled licence to a custom which, though
innocuous at present, might eventually develop into a
pernicious and dissipating habit of mind.  Edgar Ford is a
young man of excellent parts; as a son he is irreproachable,
as a friend unexceptionable.  And that reminds me,
my love, have you ever perceived that he evinces a more
tender interest than is consistent with mere friendship in
our dear young friend, Alice Martin?"
</p>

<p>
Joanna's eyes opened wide with astonishment.  "Good
gracious, Miss Drusilla, such an idea never entered my
head!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, take note when next you see the handsome
young couple in each other's company, and I feel certain
you will arrive at the conclusion that my suspicion is
not without foundation."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you are wrong&mdash;quite wrong!  Edgar
never speaks to Alice if he can help it.  In fact, I don't
think he likes her much.  Alice is not at all clever,
and Edgar thinks so much of cleverness."
</p>

<p>
"The ways of men are as a sealed book to me; and I
cannot say that it is my desire ever to have the seals
broken.  Yet I have been led to believe that masculine
minds are so constituted that mental charms do not appeal
to them as powerfully as do mere physical attractions."
</p>

<p>
Joanna shook her head.  "Edgar is different from
other men.  Paul might be taken with a pretty face, he
is so impulsive and impressionable; but Edgar is too good
and wise to care for any woman who would not be a companion
to him in all his intellectual interests and pursuits.
And though Alice is very dear and sweet and pretty, she
is extremely stupid, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yet I have heard that even good and wise men will
condone the emptiness of a female head on account of
the beauty of the face that appertains to it."
</p>

<p>
On her way home from Miss Dallicot's, Joanna fell
in with Alice, and the two girls walked on together.  After
what a chairman would call "a few preliminary remarks,"
Joanna blurted out:
</p>

<p>
"Alice, do you think that Edgar Ford admires you?
Miss Drusilla says he does."
</p>

<p>
Joanna had yet to learn that truths, like parcels, have
to be neatly wrapped up before their vendors can dispose
of them.
</p>

<p>
Alice stood still, so great was her astonishment.
"Oh, dear no!  I'm perfectly certain he doesn't.  What
an absurd idea for that dear old thing to get into her head!
But she is so busy finding long words that her wits are
apt to go wool-gathering, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  She was delicious to-day.  I did wish
that you and Paul had been there too.  It seemed a pity
for her sweetness to be wasted on the desert air of my
solitary self."
</p>

<p>
"Was she really fine?" asked Alice.
</p>

<p>
"I should just think she was.  She was like a
penny-a-liner and an eighteenth-century poet rolled in
one.
</p>

<p>
"That really was an idiotic thing to say about Edgar;
because, do you know, Joanna? he has been positively
horrid to me lately."
</p>

<p>
"Has he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, something awful.  I can't make out why, because
I've never been nasty to him, that I know of."
</p>

<p>
"You never are nasty to anybody, dear."
</p>

<p>
"I never want to be," said Alice.  "I am always so
dreadfully anxious to be liked that I try my best to be
nice to people; and when they don't like me it makes me
so wretched that I want to cry."
</p>

<p>
"I never mind whether people like me or not."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I didn't," sighed Alice, "but I do, more than
anything."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are so pretty that you are sure of being
liked, whatever you do.  People always like pretty
women," said Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so.  I'd much rather have been clever.
People get tired of prettiness, but they never do of
cleverness."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you think it is because you are not clever,
but only pretty, that Edgar has got tired of you?"
inquired the blunt Joanna, showing her inexperience of the
ways of men by the use of so absurd an expression as
"only pretty".
</p>

<p>
"I don't think that explains it.  Of course I know that
Edgar could not care much for anybody as stupid as I
am, but I think it is horrid of him to positively dislike
me for not being clever.  It really isn't my fault.  I try
awfully hard to be clever, but I find it so difficult to
understand things.  And Edgar is generally so just to
people, and so tender to their failings, that it makes it
all the nastier for me."
</p>

<p>
"But are you sure he positively dislikes you?  Perhaps
you only bore him," suggested Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I should not be a bit surprised if I bored him;
in fact I should be surprised if I did anything else.  Most
people bore Edgar, you know, and yet he is always kind
and courteous to them."
</p>

<p>
"And isn't he kind and courteous to you?"
</p>

<p>
Alice's pretty eyes filled with tears.  "No, he isn't,
and that shows how much he must hate me.  He is more
civil to his mother's housekeeper than he is to me; and
I mind it dreadfully, because he and I used to be such
friends."
</p>

<p>
"What does he do?"
</p>

<p>
"He won't speak to me if he can help it," replied
Alice, fairly crying by this time, "and when he is obliged
to say anything he does so in such a queer, hard voice
that everybody round can see how he detests me.  I
often dare not speak to him when other people are there,
for fear he should snub me before them and make me die
of shame."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you ask him if he is offended with you?"
</p>

<p>
"I did; and he said: 'Why should you suppose I am
offended with you, Miss Martin?  If my conduct has
given rise to this suspicion, I must have been sadly
wanting in courtesy, and I humbly apologize.'  Then I felt
ready to sink into the earth."
</p>

<p>
"How horrid of him!"
</p>

<p>
"He and I used to be so fond of each other when we
were children.  But lately he has put up palings all round
himself, as if he were a tree in a park, and won't let me
come near him."
</p>

<p>
"It really is queer!" agreed Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I begin to think the real reason is that he considers
us common," sobbed Alice.  "Of course I know we don't
belong to a good old family, like the Fords; but we are
just the same as we always were; and it is unkind and
snobbish of Edgar to throw over his old friends because
he is ashamed of them!"
</p>

<p>
And all that time Edgar Ford was congratulating
himself on behaving as a man of honour towards Paul and
Alice; and he was positively wearing himself out with his
superhuman efforts to hide from the latter the fact that
he cared for her.
</p>

<p>
Truly the ways of a conscientious man are sometimes
difficult to fathom!

CHAPTER IV.

Friends in Need.

<p class="poem">
  Through whatsoever ills betide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you I will be spent and spend:<br>
  I'll stand for ever by your side,<br>
  And naught shall you and me divide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you are my friend.<br>

<p>
Perhaps one of the most noteworthy characteristics
of "the people called Methodists" is the
<i>esprit de corps</i>&mdash;the spirit of clannishness&mdash;which
runs through the whole body.  Is any
sick, the rest are eager to pray; is any merry, the rest
are delighted to sing psalms; and they will not only pray
and sing in sympathy, which is comparatively easy, but
they are ready to spend and to be spent for the brethren
to any extent.  Men may know that they are Methodists
from the love they have one to another.  And this love
does not confine itself to the actual members of the
Church, but extends to their descendants, to the third
and fourth generation, even though these descendants
may have forsaken the faith of their fathers, and
embraced other forms of worship.  This clannishness is not
so much the spiritual bond of a common creed, as a more
human&mdash;and so more indissoluble&mdash;bond, like the tie of
country or of kinship; and therefore no variations in
belief can break it.
</p>

<p>
If the children of Methodism, as they grow up and see
the various phases of modern life, incline to a broader
faith or a more ornate ritual than those which satisfied
their fathers, their Mother-Church does not blame them
as perverts nor brand them as apostates; they are still
her children and she will be interested in them to the
end.  Though the daughter may forget her own people
and her father's house, she herself is ever remembered
in the old home, where there is no bitterness on account
of her forgetfulness, such forgetfulness being but the
fulfilment of a law of natural growth.
</p>

<p>
It is this spirit of kinship that accounts for the
wonderful freemasonry among all Wesleyan Methodists;
and their masonic sign&mdash;their Shibboleth, so to speak&mdash;is
their pronunciation of their denominational name.  If
a man pronounces the word Wesleyan as if the <i>s</i> were a
<i>z</i>, and puts the accent upon the second syllable, one may
safely conclude that that man has never been inside this
particular fold; but if he sounds the <i>s</i> sharply as if it
were double s, and accentuates the first syllable of the
word, all Wesleyans know that he is, or his father was
before him, one of themselves, for his speech bewrayeth
him.
</p>

<p>
When Paul had been at Oxford for upwards of two
years, and seemed on the high road to success in all his
undertakings, a sudden change came o'er the spirit of his
dream.  The bank in which Mrs. Seaton's fortune was
invested stopped payment, and the heavy calls which her
husband was obliged to pay left him with but a very
small addition to his income as a "supernumerary".  To
many men of his age this would have been a crushing
blow; but Mark Seaton's mind was so uniformly set
upon things above, and so indifferent to all earthly
considerations, that worldly misfortunes had little power to
hurt him.  But the stroke, nevertheless, fell heavily
upon his wife; not that she was more worldly-minded
than her husband, but because poverty always presses
harder upon a woman than upon a man.  Poverty meets
a man face to face upon the battle-field of life, and he
then and there either conquers or is conquered by it;
but it waylays a woman in her home, lurking for her in
the recesses of her wardrobe and jumping out upon her
from her kitchen and her storeroom; and a secret foe is
always worse than an open enemy.
</p>

<p>
The blow fell when Paul was down for the Long
Vacation, and he saw far more clearly than his father
did what it would mean to his mother and sister.  With
an intuition which was rare in so young a man, he
realized how the daily struggle to make both ends
meet&mdash;which hardly penetrated into the minister's
study&mdash;would embitter Joanna's youth and render Mrs. Seaton's
declining years but labour and sorrow to her; and with
his accustomed decision he made up his mind that this
burden must be lightened at all costs, even though the
lightening taxed him to his uttermost farthing.
</p>

<p>
"Joanna," he said one day, when he and his sister
were alone together, "I am not going back to Oxford."
</p>

<p>
"Not going back to Oxford, Paul?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply what I say.  Instead of finishing my time
there, I have decided to set about earning something at
once, so as to make life a little less hard for you and
mother."
</p>

<p>
"But there is no need for that," said Joanna.
"Mother and I were saying only yesterday what a good
thing it was that you had your scholarship and so were
independent of us."
</p>

<p>
"That's all rot!" said Paul.  "A fellow can't be
independent of his own people in that sense; and I'm
not going to have mother fagged to death over things if
I can stop it."
</p>

<p>
"But, Paul, it would spoil your career if you left
Oxford without taking your degree."
</p>

<p>
"Don't bother about that!  And besides&mdash;career or
no career&mdash;my mind is made up."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know," urged Joanna, "that father and
mother and I would gladly give up everything we have
for the sake of you and your future?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do.  And do you suppose I haven't the
same consideration for you?"
</p>

<p>
"But, Paul, it seems such a shame!"
</p>

<p>
"It's no use arguing with me.  I've made up my
mind, I tell you.  Of course I'm sorry to leave Oxford
and throw up my chance of a First and all that that
means; but, you know, there are some things a fellow
can pay too dearly for, and that is one of them."
</p>

<p>
Joanna's eyes filled with tears.  "Oh, Paul! are
you sure it is necessary?"
</p>

<p>
"Look here!  I think it is necessary that I should
set about earning some money as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"It is awfully good of you, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I don't know much about the goodness of it;
but I do know that a man couldn't very well act
differently under the circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"But, Paul, think of your boating, and how you
would miss that!"
</p>

<p>
For the first time in the conversation Paul's lip
quivered.  "Please don't let's talk about that!  Besides,
boating isn't everything."
</p>

<p>
After a few moments Joanna asked: "Then what
shall you do instead of going back to Oxford?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go and teach 'small Latin and less Greek'
to Sir Richard Esdaile's son.  I wrote to my tutor,
telling him how matters stood, and asking him if he
could put me in the way of getting a job.  And he wrote
back saying that old Esdaile&mdash;who is a chum of his&mdash;wanted
somebody to teach his small boy and prepare
him for Eton."
</p>

<p>
"And so he recommended you?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he should be pleased to recommend me to
anybody, as I took a First in Mods, and was pretty sure
to do the same in Greats if I'd stayed up.  So I shall
go to Esdaile Court after the summer holidays are
over."
</p>

<p>
"I see."
</p>

<p>
"The pay is two hundred a year," continued Paul;
"and I can send most of it home, as I shall have only
my clothes to pay for."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Paul, how good you are!"
</p>

<p>
"You see, even if I stayed on at Oxford and took
my degree and went to the Bar, it would be ages before
I could earn anything; and I feel I mustn't waste any
more time.  But I shall write articles and things for
magazines in the intervals of teaching young Esdaile his
A,B,C, and I hope in time to make a good thing out of
my pen."
</p>

<p>
"But do you think you will like teaching?" asked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I can't say anything about that at present.  Just
now my idea of teaching anybody anything is to say it
over and over again in the same words, but louder and
louder each time, with the addition of a few epithets
hurled at the stupidity of the pupil.  But I daresay I
shall warm to the work in time; and as what must be
must be, there is no good talking any more about it."
</p>

<p>
So Paul Seaton renounced his heart's desire, and
gave up his youthful dreams.  It was no light matter to
him thus to forego all the things that he had longed for
from his youth up; but he was hopeful enough to believe
that if a man can succeed in anything he can succeed
in everything, and that success is a matter of character
rather than a question of circumstance.  Therefore Paul
made up his mind that if he could not distinguish himself
in law, he would distinguish himself in letters, and would
be a great author as he might not be a great advocate;
and in the meantime he worked and waited, and did all
in his power to lighten the cloud which had fallen upon
the little home at Chayford.
</p>

<p>
And things pressed heavily there at first, before
Paul's salary had begun to come in, and before the
necessary retrenchments had been put into practice: for one
cannot reconstruct the management of a household in
a day.  But it was better for the Seatons than it might
otherwise have been, because of that wonderful Methodist
freemasonry.
</p>

<p>
"My husband and I want to know," said Mrs. Ford
to the minister one day, "if&mdash;instead of renting another
house, as you intend&mdash;you will do us the favour of living
in our little cottage.  We do not need it, as long
as our son remains unmarried; and we should not
like to let it, as Chayford Cottage has never been let.
So it really will be a kindness to us if you and
Mrs. Seaton will keep it warm for us till such time as we
want it for Edgar and his wife."
</p>

<p>
The minister grasped her hand.  "You are very good
to us," he said, and his voice shook, "but I hardly like
to take advantage of such generosity."
</p>

<p>
"Let me assure you that such a feeling is quite beside
the mark.  It is really far better for a house to be
inhabited by gentlepeople than by caretakers; and yet I
should not like to have any one living there with whom I
was not on terms of the most intimate friendship.  So
you are really conferring the favour on us."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton smiled.  "There was once another great
woman who builded a little chamber in the wall that a
prophet might abide there, and who was careful for him
with all care.  And we do not read that the prophet's
pride rebelled against the sense of obligation, nor that he
hesitated to take a favour at the great woman's hands
because she happened to be rich and he was poor."
</p>

<p>
"Because when one gets to the heart of life, and
understands that nothing is one's own but that all things
are God's, there is no such thing as a sense of obligation;
such a sense is a mere vulgar superficiality," said Mrs. Ford.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely; therefore, dear Mrs. Ford, I accept your
kind offer with more gratitude than I can express.  I can
never repay you and your husband for what you have
done for me and mine; but, like the prophet of old, I can
speak for you to the King and the Captain of the Host;
and, believe me, I shall do that every time I am on my
knees.  And may God grant more abundantly than I can
desire or conceive, all the prayers that I shall offer up on
your behalf!"
</p>

<p>
So it was arranged that the Seatons should take up
their abode at Chayford Cottage.  Thus they were saved
from paying rent&mdash;a heavy item in small homes; but,
nevertheless, the incidental expenses of moving and so
forth were so great that Mr. Seaton decided, with much
sorrow, that he should be obliged to part with his library
in order to meet them.  On hearing of this decision,
Miss Dallicot called at the minister's.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true, dear Mr. Seaton," she began, "that you
are contemplating the sale of your interesting and
valuable library?  Mrs. Ford informed me that she believed
such was the case, though she had no authority for
making the statement beyond the sanction of rumour."
</p>

<p>
"It is true, I am grieved to say," replied the minister.
"I have always made it my rule in life to pay ready
money for all things, and never to run into debt even for a
shilling's worth; therefore I am in need of some cash in
hand to pay the expenses of our move into the cottage.
My conscience would not allow me to borrow the necessary
sum, so I see no alternative but to dispose of my books."
</p>

<p>
"Still you possess so many friends who would feel it
a privilege to advance the sum you require, that it seems
a matter of regret that you will not avail yourself of the
loan."
</p>

<p>
"Do not tempt me, dear Miss Dallicot, to act against
my principles.  I have made a vow to owe no man anything,
even for an hour; and I should not feel it consistent
with my profession as a minister of Christ to run into
debt on any pretext whatsoever."
</p>

<p>
"Then that being the case," said Miss Drusilla, "you
will not deem it unseemly or commercial on my part to
inform you that I have long viewed with feelings of envy
your admirably selected collection of old books.  I have
come here to-day with the intention of making you a
reasonable offer for the same; but I felt that such an
offer would savour of impertinence if your mind were not
as yet finally made up in favour of disposing of your
valuable library."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton looked pleased.  "I am very glad to
hear you say this.  I confess it is a wrench to me to part
with my books, and I cannot disguise from myself that I
shall miss them sorely.  Yet it is a great comfort to me
to think that my carefully selected library will not be
broken up, but will be in the possession of a cultured
person capable of appreciating it."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Miss Dallicot blushing, "may I be so
mercenary as to mention the sum I should offer in
exchange for your admirable collection of volumes?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, dear Miss Dallicot.  I am, as you know,
a child in these matters, and have no idea what my library
is worth."
</p>

<p>
"The sum I should suggest is five hundred pounds;
but if you think that insufficient, pray tell me so, and I
will increase it at once."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Miss Drusilla; that seems to me far too much.
I could not take such a large sum as that for my little
library."
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, dear Mr. Seaton, it is none too much,"
said Miss Dallicot, with more charity than veracity.  "In
fact I believe at a sale your books would command a far
larger sum; but, as you remark, it would be a source of
regret to see so carefully selected a collection ruthlessly
resolved again into its integral parts."
</p>

<p>
The minister looked doubtful.  "I am a poor hand
at business, but I think you are too generous, dear
friend."
</p>

<p>
"Quite the reverse.  Take my word for it, Mr. Seaton,
I am making what is vulgarly termed a bargain.  To
obtain a valuable library, which I have long coveted, for
the comparatively trifling sum of five hundred pounds,
is a stroke of good fortune such as does not generally
fall to my portion."
</p>

<p>
Mark Seaton shook his head.  "I trust that we are
not deceiving ourselves, and letting your kindness of
heart run away with us."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not; have no doubts on that score, I
entreat you.  And now I have a favour to ask of you, if
you will not think me importunate in so doing."
</p>

<p>
"By no means, dear Miss Drusilla.  It will be the
greatest pleasure to me to do anything in my power for
so faithful a friend as you have proved yourself to be."
</p>

<p>
"The request I have to make is that you will grant
me permission to keep my library under your roof for a
time.  As you will perceive, I have no space at present
for any increase in my shelf-room.  I may possibly add
a small octagonal room to my present study, like the
one at Chayford House; but until this arrangement is
carried out, I must trespass on your kindness so far as
to leave the library I have purchased from you in your
keeping."
</p>

<p>
The minister's face glowed with innocent pleasure.
He had no suspicion of any guile on the good spinster's
part, and it rejoiced his heart to know that he and his
beloved books would not be parted just yet.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be only too delighted to oblige you in this
matter, Miss Dallicot; in fact," added he, with the air of
one imparting a new view of the question, "I myself shall
profit by the arrangement; for I am sure you will not
have any objection to my using the books as long as they
are in my charge."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, dear Mr. Seaton; I trust you will
avail yourself of the library just the same whether it is
nominally in my possession or in yours.  And it will be
a source of unbounded satisfaction to me to feel that my
treasured books are under such safe jurisdiction."
</p>

<p>
"I hope that I have not acted in a deceitful manner,"
said Miss Dallicot to herself on her way home, "but the
worthy man would not have accepted help more openly
bestowed, I fear; wherefore my little ruse was perhaps
excusable.  And I was not actually guilty of any
untruth&mdash;at least I trust I was not.  Surely the value of
anything is what it happens to be worth to us; and the
minister's library is worth far more than five hundred
pounds to me, for it represents the earthly happiness of
my dear friend and pastor.  And it is undoubtedly true
that I have no more book-room in my little home: my
shelves are already so overcrowded that a new hymn-book
would prove a superfluity to me at present.  But I
fear I overstepped the mark a little in my speech anent
the octagonal enlargement; I have no actual intention
of ever enlarging my borders, and I am sorely afraid I
conveyed the impression that such an intention formed
part of my immediate programme.  I trust that I have
not sinned in this, and done evil that good may come!"  And
the good lady sighed in much contrition of spirit,
never having read how the recording angel blots out with
a tear some entries even as he makes them.
</p>

<p>
But the entry against Miss Drusilla was not the only
erasure that the recording angel had to make that day.
</p>

<p>
"Martha," said Mrs. Seaton to her faithful handmaiden,
"it goes to my heart to say it, but I fear we
cannot keep you with us any longer."
</p>

<p>
"Well to be sure, ma'am!" exclaimed Martha, in
unfeigned surprise.  "And what may have put such a
notion as that into your head?  You'll be talking about
giving the minister notice next."
</p>

<p>
"The fact is, Martha, that we can no longer afford so
valuable a maid as yourself.  Now that our circumstances
are changed, we can only keep one servant for the very
rough work, and Miss Joanna and I must do the rest
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm glad to hear that it is the money-question
that has put you thus beside yourself, ma'am, and not
any dissatisfaction with me.  Not that I should have left,
even if such had been the case; I should have stayed
with you for your own good, even though you had given
me notice twenty times a day.  Bless you, ma'am, if I
wasn't here to look after you all, the whole place would
go to rack and ruin."
</p>

<p>
"You are right, Martha.  Home would not be home
without you!"
</p>

<p>
"Then don't multiply words any more, ma'am, or talk
nonsense about my going away.  I have made up my
mind to stay on with you all, and not to take any wages
whatsoever: and when Martha Prosser puts her foot
down, all the king's horses and all the king's men can't
pick it up again."
</p>

<p>
"But, dear Martha, we can't let you go on serving us
without wages."
</p>

<p>
"And why not, I should like to know?  What do I
want with wages?  My face is too plain for me to care
to spend money on my back&mdash;which is no secret, being
there for all the world to see.  And I don't hold with
saving, ma'am.  Money is like the manna, to my thinking;
it is all very well to supply the needs of the passing
day, but when you begin to save it up it doesn't improve
with keeping."
</p>

<p>
"Yet we should all of us lay by what we can for our
old age," suggested Mrs. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
"I don't hold with that, neither.  It is a poor compliment,
to my mind, to say, 'The Lord will provide'; and
then to bolster Him up with a bank-book, as if He
couldn't do His part of the business without our
assistance.  My conscience alive!  If we'll only do our part
properly, He'll do His, never fear!"
</p>

<p>
The minister's wife did not reply in words; but she
threw her arms round Martha's neck, and sobbed out her
griefs and her gratitude on that faithful breast.
</p>

<p>
As for Martha, when she had soothed and comforted
her mistress, she armed herself with the wisdom of the
serpent, and knocked at the door of the minister's study.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, sir," she said in a sepulchral tone, "I
want to consult you about a spiritual difficulty."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Martha, certainly," replied Mr. Seaton
with much warmth, feeling far more at home on eternal
than on temporal ground.  "Sit down and tell me all
about it, and I will see how I can help you."
</p>

<p>
Thus adjured, Martha took a seat.  "I used to think,"
she began, "that when one had got to a sensible age, one
would have outgrown the snares and wiles of the devil;
but, bless my soul! he has got them suited to fit all ages
and sizes, as they say of ready-made clothes."
</p>

<p>
"He has indeed, my poor Martha; and it is when we
think he has no longer the power to harm us that he is
most to be dreaded.  But tell me, what is the temptation
that has been assailing you now?"
</p>

<p>
Martha's face was the picture of gloom as she replied:
"I feel that covetousness and the love of money are
creeping upon me in my old age; and we all know that
the Lord hateth the covetous man, and that the love of
money is the root of all evil."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton's face was very tender as he answered:
"I fancy that you are unduly distressing yourself.  Surely
I, who know you so well and with whom you have met
in class all these years, should have perceived this fault
in your character had it ever existed.  Believe me, your
conscience is over-sensitive, and now falsely accuses you."
</p>

<p>
But Martha shook her head.  "The heart knoweth
its own bitterness," she replied, "and I want you to help
me to conquer the devil, and not explain him away.  As
my Aunt Matilda Jane said, when the doctor told her she
had nasal catarrh: 'It is a common cold in the head, and
I haven't sent for you to christen it but to cure it'.  That
is what Aunt Matilda Jane said, and she had right
on her side, to my thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Martha, if, as you say, the sin of covetousness
is lying in wait for your soul, I can only pray for you, and
entreat you to watch as well as pray that you enter not
into this temptation."
</p>

<p>
"That is not enough.  There is more than prayer
wanted in my case.  Not that prayer is not sufficient for
some, and I should be the last to say a word against it;
but I want something more myself," replied the penitent.
</p>

<p>
"Then tell me what that more is," demanded
Martha's spiritual adviser, in some perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to remove the temptation far from me,
so that I can no longer behold the accursed thing.  In
fact I want you to take all my savings, and spend them,
and never let me hear of them again, they being but
filthy lucre at best, and amounting to one hundred and
eleven pounds, fifteen shillings and sixpence in all,"
added the excited Martha, thrusting her bank-book into
her master's hand.  "If I keep them, they may draw
my soul into perdition, and make me as them that have
their portion in this life; while if you'll only take and
spend them, you'll save my soul alive, and be able to
have a fire in your bedroom all the winter, which the
mistress ought never to be without, her being so
rheumatic, bless her dear heart!"
</p>

<p>
Then at last the minister understood; and he also
understood that when any pilgrim's face is set as though
to go to Jerusalem, it is no sign of true apostleship to
try to turn that pilgrim back.  So he took Martha's
bank-book into his keeping, until such time as he saw fit
to return it to her.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Martha," he said, and his eyes were
full of tears.  "I will do as you bid me, and shall be
able to see that your dear mistress lacks nothing during
the coming winter, owing to your generosity.  And you
in your turn will always remember that in this household,
as in the early Church, we have all things in common;
and that whatever is ours is also yours."
</p>

<p>
"Then that's settled," replied Martha cheerfully;
"and now I must go back to the kitchen to see the oven,
which is apt to burn the pie-crust without baking it,
unless duly warned and admonished by them that have
authority.  You'd wonder how an oven could burn
without baking; but human nature is deceitful above all
things and desperately wicked, and our kitchen oven is
one of the worst."
</p>

<p>
"Yet, Martha, God is very good, and therefore human
nature is sometimes very good likewise; I have certainly
proved it of late."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, sir, it is in this way," expounded
Martha.  "God made man in His own image; and though
man spoils himself in the making, and loses his proper
pattern, and falls out of shape, the original mould is not
broken yet&mdash;nor never will be, trust the Lord for that!"

CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
Water-lilies.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I will crown you as my queen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By my soul's subjection,<br>
  For you all your life have been<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think perfection.<br>
</p>

<p>
Paul felt leaving Oxford more than he would
have cared to confess; and the weeks he spent
at home would have been a dreary time had
they not been brightened by the smiles and
the sympathy of Alice Martin.
</p>

<p>
To Paul's vigorous and energetic nature, Alice was
very soothing and restful.  It was true that she did not
understand more than half of what he said to her, but
she listened to it all, which was nearly as good; and "a
girl could not be expected to enter into a man's thoughts
and feelings," Paul said to himself, not having yet
graduated in Cupid's University.  And Paul came very near to
loving Alice in those days, with the sort of comfortable,
common-place, every-day love which satisfies ninety-nine
men and one woman out of every hundred.  But Paul,
unfortunately, happened to be the one, and Alice one of
the ninety-nine; so there was not much chance of their
making one another happy.
</p>

<p>
One day in the summer in which Paul left Oxford, he
and Joanna, with Edgar Ford and Alice Martin, went for
a picnic to Chayford Wood.  Edgar had ceased to make
himself disagreeable to Alice, no man being able to
perform the impossible for too long a time at a stretch; and
Alice sunned herself in his reawakened smiles, not even
her love for Paul having the power to stamp out her
desire for universal popularity.
</p>

<p>
As they were sitting by the lake Alice remarked:
"Isn't it funny how a lovely scene like this makes one
feel good and happy, and yet sad with longing for
something that one has never heard of?"
</p>

<p>
"I am never sad with longing for what I never heard
of," replied Joanna.  "Whenever I feel sad, I always
know it means that I want to see Mrs. Crozier again."
</p>

<p>
"Are you still very devoted to Mrs. Crozier?"
inquired Alice.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am.  I'd do anything in the world for her."
</p>

<p>
"Anything wrong or foolish do you mean?" asked Edgar.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  She'd never want me to do anything
wrong or foolish."
</p>

<p>
"That is not the question," said Edgar, who greatly
loved to tease Joanna.  "Would you if she did?"
</p>

<p>
"But she wouldn't.  Would you do anything wrong
or foolish for any one you cared much for?" inquired
Joanna, turning the tables on her adversary.
</p>

<p>
Edgar thought for a moment.  "Anything wrong, no;
anything foolish, yes," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"I was reading a poem the other day," said Alice,
"about a lady who threw her glove into the lions' den to
test her lover's affection; he jumped into the den and
rescued the glove, only to fling it into the lady's face.  I
cannot make up my mind whether he was right or not."
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly he was," replied Paul, in his highly
superior manner.  "To make an exhibition of so sacred
a thing as a man's love proved the woman to be vain
and frivolous, and incapable of seeing the deeper thing.
Therefore the man was better without her than with her,
and he did well to throw her over.  There is nothing so
revolting to a man as frivolity in a woman.  When deep
calleth unto deep, love reaches perfection; when shallow
calleth unto shallow, there is not much harm done; but
when deep calleth unto shallow, the tragedies of life
begin."
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure that the lady was so frivolous," said
Edgar thoughtfully.  "Probably she was sick to death
of the adulation of empty-headed and empty-hearted
courtiers, and wanted to prove to herself and to the
assembled court that this particular knight really cared for
her.  In which case the deep called unto shallow indeed;
but the lady was the deep and the knight the shallow."
</p>

<p>
"I do not agree with you at all," answered Paul
rather hotly, "she was vain and frivolous, and wanted
to make the other women jealous by showing off the
devotion of her young man.  And I'd see a woman at
Jericho before I'd make an exhibition of my love for her
to excite the envy of her rivals."
</p>

<p>
"Gently, my young friend," said Edgar with his
pleasant smile.  "If you really loved a woman you'd give
her your heart out and out; and whether she cherished
it or played with it would be her concern, not yours."
</p>

<p>
"But no nice woman would want to play with it,"
remarked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that," replied Edgar.  "Even nice
women have their little vanities, and like to prove the
extent of their power over men.  Besides, if one really
loved a woman, one would go on loving her just the
same, even if she did the things that one did not
consider nice; of course one would hate the things, but that
would make no difference in loving the woman."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes, it would," cried Paul.  "I should leave
off loving a woman at; once if she did things that I
did not approve of.  I don't say that it would not hurt
at the time; but the wrench of thrusting her out of my
life then and there would not hurt half so much in the
long run as letting her go on withering up my affections
and knocking down my ideals.  In the former case I
should lose her and keep myself; in the latter I should
lose both myself and her."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear fellow, you wouldn't bother about
yourself; you'd only know that you could not afford to
lose the woman; so you would rescue her glove from the
lions and then button it for her."
</p>

<p>
"Not I!  I should teach her a lesson and then have
done with her."
</p>

<p>
Edgar laughed.  "My good Paul, who wants to teach
women lessons?  You talk as if they were schoolboys,
and you really are old enough to know better."
</p>

<p>
"But do you mean to say, Edgar," asked Joanna,
"that you would let any woman make a plaything or a
door-mat of you?"
</p>

<p>
"By all means, if I loved her and she was so minded.
If I really cared for her, you see, I should think it the
greatest honour to be elevated to the uses of her
playthings and her door-mats, and I should count myself
unworthy to be adapted to such purposes."
</p>

<p>
"I call that unmanly," remarked Paul.  "Even if a
man does love a woman, he owes a duty to himself as
well as to her."
</p>

<p>
Edgar merely chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing to laugh at," quoth Paul severely.
"I did not say anything humorous."
</p>

<p>
"Not intentionally," murmured Edgar.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," continued Paul, "that a man is
unfair to himself and to the woman when he grovels at
her feet.  A sensible and equal affection is better for
both of them."
</p>

<p>
"O noble judge!  O excellent young man!" exclaimed Edgar.
</p>

<p>
"What I am saying is common sense," added Paul,
"though you appear to think me harsh and unloving."
</p>

<p>
"Not harsh and unloving, my dear Paul; merely
foolish and ignorant," replied Edgar.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot see the sense of throwing a glove among
lions just for the sake of picking it up again," said the
sensible Joanna.  "It seems to me a most unnecessary
and absurd action."
</p>

<p>
"It would be nice to feel that a man liked you well
enough to perform unnecessary and absurd actions for
your sake," added Alice wistfully.
</p>

<p>
Edgar looked at her, but he said nothing; he only
understood.
</p>

<p>
"It would not please me if men did absurd things
for my sake," persisted Joanna.  "It would only please
me if they did good and noble things to win my regard."
</p>

<p>
"Joanna is quite right," agreed Joanna's brother
approvingly.  "Vain women do men a lot of harm."
</p>

<p>
"Even if they like them?" suggested Alice.
</p>

<p>
"Of course; the more the men like them, the more
harm they do.  But the worst of women is," continued
Paul, "that they are always wanting to see what will
happen if they do certain things.  They make a man
angry just to see what he looks like when he is angry;
and they make a man miserable just to see what he
looks like when he is miserable; and they never realize how
much gratuitous suffering all this entails upon the man."
</p>

<p>
"But they haven't the slightest idea how much it
hurts," said Edgar.  "They know that it is all a sort of
histrionic performance or scientific experiment, and they
expect the man to treat the matter from the same
intellectual standpoint.  While as for him, poor beggar! he
only knows that he is being broken on the wheel, and he
cannot for the life of him see the object of it, as you say."
</p>

<p>
Now Alice was a good girl as well as a pretty girl,
and amiable and unselfish into the bargain; but she
was not the reigning beauty of Chayford for nothing,
and she now and again wanted&mdash;like other queens&mdash;to
try on her regalia.  So she said, in her sweet plaintive
voice, "I should so like some of those water-lilies from
the far side of the pool."
</p>

<p>
The said lilies grew under a steep and slippery bank
which was the only approach to them, there being no
boat on Chayford Pool at this particular time.  Both
men looked across the pool, and Paul shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you can't have them," he said, "till
there is a boat on the water.  The bank is not really
safe after the heavy rains we have had lately."
</p>

<p>
Alice pouted.  "But I want them now; they will be
all over by the time the boats are in use."
</p>

<p>
Edgar looked at her.  "Do you really care very
much about them?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do," replied Alice.  "They are my
favourite flowers, and I want some dreadfully."
</p>

<p>
"Then you shall have some," said Edgar quietly,
walking off in the direction of the lilies, round the end
of the pool.
</p>

<p>
Paul's brow grew very black.  "Don't be a fool,
Edgar!" he cried roughly.  "That bank really is not
safe; and a girl's whim is not worth the price of a
wetting, especially to a delicate fellow like you.  Alice,
what are you thinking of?  Tell him at once he is not
to go."
</p>

<p>
But Alice's usually equable temper was so ruffled by
Paul's brusqueness, and she would not do as he bade
her.
</p>

<p>
"Alice, don't you hear what I am saying?  Tell him
that he is not to go," repeated Paul.
</p>

<p>
But Alice's gentle spirit was so sore from the effect
of Paul's indifference to her, that she shut her pretty
mouth obstinately and would not interfere.
</p>

<p>
"If Paul is so horrid to me he shall see that other
men admire me," she said to herself; "and that will
add to my importance in his eyes."
</p>

<p>
Finding that Alice was obdurate, Paul ran after
Edgar to endeavour to dissuade him from so foolhardy
an attempt; but before he reached him, Edgar was
half-way down the slippery bank.
</p>

<p>
By keeping "one foot on sea and one on shore," and
by grasping the overhanging bough of a birch tree,
Edgar managed to gather a handful of the desired lilies;
but when he tried to return, his shore foot slipped, and
he fell into the water.  By that time Paul had overtaken
his friend, and was able to help Edgar out of the pool
and up the bank; but not before the latter had suffered
a thorough soaking, which brought on a severe chill.
</p>

<p>
Edgar was laid up for several days in consequence
of his immersion in Chayford Pool, during which time
Paul visited him constantly, and Alice as constantly
sent him flowers and books and little scented notes;
for her tender heart was wrung with remorse for the
consequences of her vanity.  Edgar quite understood
this remorse and accepted it, for he knew Alice better
than Paul did; but remorse was not the particular thing
he was wanting from her just then.
</p>

<p>
"I say, old fellow," said Paul to him one day, "I
shall never like Alice again, after the scurvy trick she
played you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! don't say that," besought Edgar, bravely fighting
Alice's battle with Paul, though it was no easy task
to him to do so.  "It was only a little bit of feminine
vanity on her part, which ninety-nine pretty girls out of
every hundred would have indulged in."
</p>

<p>
"Then deliver me from ninety-nine pretty girls out
of every hundred!" prayed Paul.
</p>

<p>
"It really isn't fair to blame her, old boy!  She had
no idea there was any risk in the thing, and she has been
far more sorry for me and more kind to me than I deserve
ever since."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I don't mean to say that she deliberately
planned to make you ill, nor do I deny that her penitence
is sincere; all I say is that the shallow vanity which
induces a woman to expose a man to danger, or even to
discomfort, to gratify a mere whim of hers, is a thing
which is simply revolting to me.  It is not that I cannot
forgive her: I could forgive far worse things than this, if
they had their origin in something deeper&mdash;even if more
dangerous&mdash;than mere vanity.  I am not at war with
her; but I know and feel that I shall never like her
again."
</p>

<p>
Edgar puffed at his pipe in silence for some moments.
"I used to think you cared for Alice," he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"I used to think so too, at one time," answered Paul
slowly, "but I know now I was mistaken.  I liked her
beauty and her pretty sympathetic manner, and I found
her very soothing when I was irritable and out of temper.
But there was always something which disappointed me
in her.  She is charming and pleasant, like a walled
flower garden; but there is no 'beyond' in Alice.  The
woman I love must not only have a garden in the front
of her character to gladden my eyes every day, but there
must also be glimpses of a view beyond, of sunny lands
of Beulah and of mountains reaching up to heaven."
</p>

<p>
Edgar smoked in silence.
</p>

<p>
"There are three things which combine to produce
love," continued Paul, in his youthfully didactic way;
"moral excellence, intellectual companionship and physical
charm.  Of course if one can get the three in a line,
one is right for all time; but generally one has to put up
with only two.  I respected Alice's character and I felt
her charm; but intellectually she and I were never
comrades; nevertheless I fancied that two conditions out of
the three might prove enough.  After her conduct the
other day, however, I saw that, though sweet and
amiable, there was something small and paltry in her
nature.  Therefore she has now ceased to appeal to the
second side of me; and personal beauty alone is not
sufficient to satisfy me in a wife.  So out of my future
life Alice goes."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you mean to say that, as far as you are
concerned, another man has the right to try and win
Alice?"
</p>

<p>
Paul looked up in surprise.  "Of course!  Why not?
You don't mean to say that you care for her?"
</p>

<p>
"But I do," answered Edgar with his quiet smile;
"I have cared for her all her life, and I shall continue to
do so all mine.  But I stood on one side because I
thought you loved her."  He was too chivalrous to say,
"because I thought she loved you".
</p>

<p>
"Well, go in and win, old man!" cried Paul, grasping
his friend's hand.  "But don't you think that her action
the other day was rather small and petty?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I would rather not discuss Alice even with
you, my dear fellow.  You see, I should knock down any
man who dared to say a word against her, and I should
be sorry if that man happened to be yourself."
</p>

<p>
"All right; I beg your pardon.  All that I can say is
that I think Alice is the luckiest girl I know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid she won't think so."
</p>

<p>
"Why? don't you think she cares for you?" inquired
the unperceiving Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure she doesn't, worse luck for me!"
</p>

<p>
"Well then, she will soon learn to do so, there is no
doubt of that, now that she has seen how much you care
for her."
</p>

<p>
Edgar smiled rather sadly.  "I have succeeded in
teaching her that there is no one in the world but her;
but I have not yet taught her that there is no one in the
world but me."
</p>

<p>
"She will soon learn it, never fear! with such a
schoolmaster."
</p>

<p>
But poor Edgar did not feel quite so sure.
</p>

<p>
And Alice all the time was telling herself that since
Edgar loved her so much, Paul was certain to love her
too; an illogical argument, perhaps, but one most
convincing to the normal female mind.  She did not know,
poor child! that with her own hands she had shut the
door of the Eden which she coveted; and that the hands
which have power to shut have not necessarily the
power to open again.
</p>

<p>
Alas for us all that the gate of Eden is so hard to
seek, and that so few succeed in finding it!  And those
of us who are fortunate enough to discover it, must take
heed to our ways lest it close with a spring, and open to
us never again, knock we never so loudly.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
Esdaile Court.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Their ways were ways of pleasant grace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They toiled not neither did they spin;<br>
  But since their smiles made glad the place,<br>
  Dare men of sterner cast of face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Account such carelessness a sin?<br>
</p>

<p>
It was on a sunny September afternoon that Paul
Seaton first saw Esdaile Court; and the mellowed
Elizabethan house, with its stately avenues and
large lake, was very pleasant to look upon in the
autumn sunlight.  On his arrival he was ushered by a
stout and pompous butler into the drawing-room, where
Lady Esdaile was taking tea with her son and daughter,
aged respectively nine and fourteen.  Lady Esdaile had
been a great beauty in her day, and at eight-and-thirty
was still a lovely woman.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Mr. Beaton?" she began.  "How
nice of you to come just in time for tea!  Violet and
Dick are having tea with me to-day for a treat, but they
generally have it in the schoolroom, don't you know?
Come, children, this is Mr. Beaton who is so kind as to
come and teach Dick."
</p>

<p>
Violet, who inherited her mother's beauty, treated
the new tutor to a supercilious little nod; but Dick, a
plain and wholesome little boy, thrust a sticky and
jam-besprinkled palm into Paul's outstretched hand.
</p>

<p>
"I say," said Dick, "I've been out shooting with
father to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Have you?" replied Paul with polite interest.  "I
hope you have had good sport."
</p>

<p>
Dick shook his little red head.  "We had bad luck,"
he said, "shocking bad luck; only four brace and a
couple of hares all day.  But father let me carry the
birds home, and I got my clothes covered with blood," he
added more cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"As Dick has been out all day, and walked so far, I
am letting him have an egg with his tea," said Lady
Esdaile, "and he insists upon eating bread and jam with
it.  I wish he wouldn't!  Do you think it will make
him ill?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say.  It is not a combination that would
suit me, but other times other manners, you know, Lady
Esdaile."
</p>

<p>
"What a fuss you make about a chap, mother!"
exclaimed Dick with scorn.  "I'm all right and feel as
fit as a fiddle.  But it is enough to make a fellow sick to
hear you talking so much about whether things are good
for us or not."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, darling.  But promise me you will leave
off eating jam with your egg the minute you begin to feel
not quite well.  And, oh!  Mr. Sebright, I was forgetting
all about you, and you have had such a long journey and
must want your tea dreadfully!  How stupid I am!"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  The journey from Chayford is quite a
short one really, only there are so many changes it
makes it rather troublesome."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  I hate changes, don't you? just when
you've got your things all about the carriage and are
settling yourself down to a nice book, a horrid guard or
porter or something comes shouting at you, and makes
you jump out of your carriage and leave half your things
behind.  And my maid never will help at stations,
because she hates travelling and is offended with me
every time I take her from home.  She says the train
makes her giddy or something.  And you see I can't go
without her, because I couldn't do my own hair to save
my life."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not," said Paul, feeling very much amused
by her ladyship's flow of conversation.
</p>

<p>
"And there, I have gone and forgotten your tea
again!  How careless I am!  I am afraid this tea is not
very fresh, Mr. Sebright; in fact it has stood for over
an hour; but Simmons (that is the butler) is so dreadfully
offended if I send out for fresh tea to be made
during the afternoon, that I really dare not do it.  You
won't mind much, will you, if it is rather strong and
cold?"
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled, and forsook the paths of rectitude so
far as to assure her ladyship that tea on the lees was
the beverage he fancied above all others.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how dear of you to say that!  And you can
have as much hot water as you like, though the hot
water is cold too.  But it will take off the bitter taste
which makes the special nastiness of old tea.  Is it very
bad, now you come to drink it?" asked Lady Esdaile
with sympathetic interest.
</p>

<p>
Paul lied bravely.  "It is delicious."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad.  It really is tiresome having a butler
who takes offence if you ask him to do anything!"
</p>

<p>
"It must make life very difficult, Lady Esdaile."
</p>

<p>
"It does; very difficult indeed.  I often don't get
enough to eat, because I daren't ask for more when
Simmons is carving; but I make up with vegetables,
because the footmen hand them, and I'm not afraid of
a footman.  Still, vegetables without meat are very
fattening, don't you think? and the dread of my life is
to get fat.  I don't think that any woman looks well
when she is fat, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I really don't know," answered Paul, who had
hitherto lived among women who cared for none of
these things.  "I am afraid I never thought about it."
</p>

<p>
"How quaint of you!  But you are awfully clever,
you see, and so never think about anything but books
and sums and things.  Now I'm not a bit clever or
learned or anything."
</p>

<p>
Paul again wandered from the path of the upright
by expressing polite surprise at this platitude.
</p>

<p>
"Have another cup of tea&mdash;do," begged Lady Esdaile.
"If you don't, I shall know you told a story
about its not tasting as bad as we expected."
</p>

<p>
And Paul was so charmed by her ladyship's beauty
and good-nature, that he asked for another cup, and
swallowed the same without wincing.  Nevertheless he
possessed the spirit of a philanthropist, so he remarked:
"There is a sort of arrangement, I've seen somewhere,
of putting the tea-leaves into a little bag and pouring the
hot water over them.  Then the leaves are removed;
so that however long the tea stands, it never gets any
stronger."
</p>

<p>
"What a lovely idea! and it would be such fun
taking the tea-leaves out again while they were all wet."
</p>

<p>
"It would make a jolly mess, I bet!" agreed Dick
enthusiastically.  "You'd always let me do it, wouldn't
you, mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, darling, if you would promise to take
care not to burn your fingers."
</p>

<p>
"I'd make a fine splash all over the cloth!"
chuckled Dick.
</p>

<p>
"What a dirty boy you are!" said Violet reprovingly.
</p>

<p>
Dick did not reply to his sister in words; but he
turned upon her such a wilfully contorted countenance
that Violet dissolved into laughter.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm afraid Simmons wouldn't approve of that
arrangement," sighed Lady Esdaile.  "He always sets
his face against anything fresh.  I remember once Sir
Richard bought a new kind of carving-knife&mdash;a <i>patent
masticator</i>, I think it was called, or some such disgusting
name&mdash;and Simmons said he would give notice rather
than demean himself by using it.  He had carved for
the family for thirty years, he said, and his own right
hand had been enough all that time, and would be till
the end; it wasn't true, because he had always used
a carving-knife of some sort; but Simmons is quite
poetical when he is excited."
</p>

<p>
"What did Sir Richard do?" asked Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! he roared with laughter and threw the thing
behind the fire.  To tell the truth, I believe Richard is
as much afraid of Simmons as I am; but he'd rather
die than own it."
</p>

<p>
Paul very soon settled down in his new quarters at
Esdaile Court.  He liked the place and the people.
The latter were so different from everything that he had
been accustomed to, that they completely fascinated him.
Their wheels were all well oiled; and so they took life
easily, and never seemed to look below the surface of
things.  And yet they did their duty in the state of life
to which they were called; and they were high-minded
and upright and well-bred, and were careful to act
honourably and charitably towards their neighbours,
and to go to the parish church regularly once every
Sunday.  They never talked about their hearts or their
souls or their consciences; but ate and drank and were
merry, and made the corner of the earth where their lot
was cast a better place for their being in it.
</p>

<p>
Sir Richard Esdaile was a typical fox-hunting
English squire, a good many years older than his
beautiful wife, of whom he was intensely proud.  He
and Paul got on very well together, though they had
nothing in common, save their mutual respect and
admiration.  As for little Dick, he at once began to adore
Paul, and appointed his tutor his final court of appeal
in all things; and Paul grew very fond of Dick, and
was a better man for it.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose Dick will go into the army when he
grows up," said Paul to Lady Esdaile one day.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so, if he can get through those silly,
tiresome examinations.  And if he does, I do hope he'll
go into a regiment where there is a pretty uniform; a
blue one would be best for him with his red hair.  I
don't like scarlet with red hair, do you, Mr. Seaton?"  Lady
Esdaile had mastered Paul's name by this time.
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.  "I don't think it matters to a man
what colour his clothes are."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"No; do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes, dreadfully.  I always adore to see men in
dark blue.  Think how nice a blue serge morning-suit
looks on a man, and how sweet sailors always are!  Of
course a pink coat looks jolly for hunting, but I don't
like red uniforms half as well as blue ones&mdash;especially for
fair hair."
</p>

<p>
Lady Esdaile's way of looking at life was a source of
never-ending amusement to Paul; she always seemed to
be gazing at the world through the wrong end of a
telescope.  And Paul was not as severe on frivolity as he
had been in the days when he so ruthlessly passed
sentence on Alice; he was becoming more a man of the
world, and consequently more sympathetic with, and
tender towards, human nature.  For life teaches a man
more than all the Universities rolled in one.
</p>

<p>
"I've just had such a fright," Lady Esdaile confided
to her son's tutor, when the latter had been about a year
at Esdaile.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?  Can I assist in anyway?"
asked Paul, who was the help of the family in all
difficulties, from the writing of French menus to the letting
of cats out of traps.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid Isabel Carnaby was coming to live
with us."
</p>

<p>
"But who is Isabel Carnaby?  I fear I cannot gauge
the extent of your anxiety till I know who the lady is."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I thought everybody knew Isabel.  She is my
husband's niece He had two sisters, Lady Farley and
Mrs. Carnaby.  Isabel was the Carnabys' only child,
and Mrs. Carnaby died when she was born.  It was a
pity Mrs. Carnaby died, she had such lovely blue eyes
and such a knack of knowing what suited her.  She was
the best-dressed woman I ever met, and Major Carnaby
was devoted to her."
</p>

<p>
"Is Major Carnaby dead?" asked Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; he died out in India while Isabel was still a
child, and she has lived with the Farleys ever since.  She
is fairly well off; and her father left word in his will that
when she was of age she must decide whether to live with
the Farleys or with us, as both Sir Benjamin and my
husband were ready to take her for her mother's sake.
She has just come of age, and I was dreadfully afraid
she would decide to come to us."
</p>

<p>
"And you wouldn't have liked it?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I hate girls of that age; they always say you
are getting stout, and that your hair isn't all your own."
</p>

<p>
Paul concealed a smile.  "Did she give the apple to
Sir Benjamin?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; to my great relief.  Sir Benjamin has got a
governorship out in India, so Isabel has chosen to go on
living with them.  She is just the sort of girl to like
being with 'Excellencies,' and all that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"What is Miss Carnaby like?  Is she pretty?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no; not pretty, but smart and stylish, and
knows how to put her clothes on.  And she is dreadfully
clever.  She positively terrified me the last time she was
over in England."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of cleverness?  Does she write books?"
asked Paul, who was always interested in literary
ventures.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, no; not so bad as that!" replied Lady
Esdaile, looking shocked.  "But she reads a good deal,
and says sharp things, and you never know whether she
is laughing at you or not.  She makes me quite nervous."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like that sort of sharpness&mdash;especially in a
woman."
</p>

<p>
"No more do I.  And then Isabel is so abominably
vain.  And I don't see anything to be conceited about in
mere cleverness; do you?  It isn't as if she were pretty."
</p>

<p>
"Still even clever people are sometimes conceited,
Lady Esdaile."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! of course cleverness in a man is awfully nice,
and quite a thing to be conceited about," owned her
ladyship graciously.  "I can't tell you how much my husband
and I admire your cleverness, nor how thankful we are
for Dick to have the advantage of it.  But I don't think
it is quite the thing for a girl; do you?  Prettiness is so
much more important."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose beauty is the best gift for a woman to
possess," said Paul; "but there are clever women and
clever women; and Miss Carnaby seems&mdash;from your
description&mdash;to be exactly the sort of clever woman that I
specially detest."
</p>

<p>
Lady Esdaile shook her head.  "Men don't generally
detest her," she confessed, "she is a man's woman out
and out.  And she is a woman's woman too," she added;
"she really can make herself awfully pleasant if she likes,
and she has a wonderful knack of getting on with anybody.
She is simply splendid if you have got a lot of dull
people in hand; there is nobody she cannot talk to.  I
believe if she met the man in the moon she would find
out that he and she had a lot of mutual acquaintances,
even if they weren't related to one another."
</p>

<p>
"Then she has her good points?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It seems to me that the great question everybody
is asking everybody else is: 'Do you know the
So-and-Sos?'  If you do know them, the conversation
flourishes; and if you don't, it drops.  The So-and-Sos
are really far more important as a conversational opening
than the weather.  I always think it rather <i>bourgeois</i> to
talk about the weather; don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"It certainly is a hackneyed subject," owned Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Isabel invariably does know the So-and-Sos;
and therefore, socially, she is a success.  Take her to the
dreariest tea-party, and in five minutes there is a buzz of
conversation."
</p>

<p>
"Then she is popular, I presume, and therefore
spoiled.  I don't generally like what are termed popular
people, I am afraid."
</p>

<p>
"To a certain extent she is popular," said Lady
Esdaile grudgingly.  "That is to say, she has always
crowds of men fluttering round her.  Sir Richard expects
that she will make a brilliant marriage out in India; but
I'm not so sure.  The clever women may get the most
partners, but it is the handsome ones that make the best
matches."
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyway, I am very glad she is not coming here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I daresay you'd have got on with her all right.
You and she could have talked about books and things,
don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "But there are other things to be
talked about besides books, Lady Esdaile."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but some people find books awfully interesting.
I should myself if they didn't always send me to sleep
before I had properly got into them."
</p>

<p>
And Paul smiled again.
</p>

<p>
So Isabel Carnaby did not come to Esdaile Court
just then, and Paul went on with his teaching of Dick;
and made wonderful progress, considering the raw
material out of which he was expected to manufacture a
scholar.  He also tried his hand at literature, and earned
an additional hundred a year by his contributions to
magazines; whereby life at the cottage at Chayford was made
considerably easier than it would otherwise have been.
</p>

<p>
At Chayford things went on much the same as usual.
Edgar continued to woo Alice in silence, and consequently
in vain; but he comforted himself by the idea that, as
she grew older and found how false and fickle the world
is, she would learn the value of one faithful heart that
would never fail her, however unworthy she might prove
herself to be.  As for her, her mind was still full of
thoughts of Paul.  He was not on the spot, it is true, as
Edgar was, but he came home every holidays; and it
takes an exceptionally clever woman to forget a man in
three months&mdash;even when she has another man to help
her.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
Isabel Carnaby.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The little blind god, as he softly trod,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did a dart for his bow prepare;<br>
  And he sharpened it with a woman's wit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he feathered it with her hair.<br>
</p>

<p>
When Paul had been four years at Esdaile
Court, and Dick was considered nearly
ready for Eton, the Farleys' term of Indian
governorship came to an end, and they returned
to England bringing their niece with them.  As
Lady Esdaile had predicted, Isabel had failed to make a
brilliant marriage out in India; but whether that were her
fault or her misfortune, Isabel alone (with the exception
of two or three young officers who were still too sore to
refer to the subject) could say.
</p>

<p>
To Paul's horror, the Anglo-Indian trio came to stay
at Esdaile, and he was appointed to take Miss Carnaby
in to dinner on the night of her arrival.  He disliked all
he had heard of the girl, and he made up his mind to
snub her as much as was compatible with good manners,
and not to allow her to fall into the error of imagining
for one moment that he would ever be dragged captive
at her chariot-wheels.
</p>

<p>
The Farley party had arrived only just in time to
dress; and the drawing-room was already half full of
county magnates and their attendant wives, when Sir
Benjamin and his two ladies came in.
</p>

<p>
Sir Benjamin was short and stout, and her ladyship
was tall and thin; she evidently possessed the remains
of striking beauty, which he&mdash;as evidently&mdash;did not.
Isabel followed them with an air of perfect assurance
that somehow irritated Paul; she really was not
good-looking enough to give herself such airs, he thought; for
he was as yet too unlearned to know that her gown was
fresh from Paris, and was the very acme of the prevailing
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Let me present you to Miss Carnaby," said Lady
Esdaile's voice.  "Isabel, this is Mr. Seaton, who will
take you in to dinner."
</p>

<p>
Paul prepared himself to meet a fellow-Greek, and to
return Miss Carnaby's bow as superciliously as she made
it; but he was completely taken aback when she held out
a friendly little ungloved hand, saying: "I'm so awfully
pleased to meet you, Mr. Seaton!  Dick tells me that
you can blow birds' eggs better than any man he
knows; and a past-master in any art is always interesting
to me."
</p>

<p>
"It is very kind of you to say so, Miss Carnaby."
Paul was still a little stiff.  He certainly had some
excuse for feeling annoyed; he had armed himself to
rebuff airs and graces, and here was the most natural
girl he had ever met in his life.  He felt that even
Joanna and Alice would seem affected beside her, she
was so perfectly at her ease.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you are taking me in to dinner," she
continued, as the whole party trooped dining-room-wards;
"all the other men in the room are so old.  And
I'm dreadfully tired of going in to dinner with my
extreme seniors.  Would you believe it?  One week&mdash;since
we came home&mdash;the united ages of the men who took
me in to dinner amounted to three hundred.  I looked in
<i>Debrett</i>, and added them up."
</p>

<p>
Paul thawed sufficiently to smile.  "That was
rather rough on you!"
</p>

<p>
"It was simply unbearable.  They would explain
things to me, and try to instruct me.  And they ran to
anecdotes and statistics at the slightest provocation.  One
told me of all the reductions in rent he'd made to his
tenants during the last twenty years; and another gave
me such an exhaustive description of every attack of gout
he'd ever suffered, that I could write a biography of that
man's big toe."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless I hope you showed a teachable spirit
in listening to them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes.  I didn't really listen, but I kept counting
a hundred and then saying, 'How very interesting'.
And then counting another hundred, and saying it again.
You can't think what a good idea it was.  It was like my
aunt's plan of counting imaginary geese to send yourself
to sleep; which, by the way, always keeps me awake the
whole night."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  My mother favours that plan too, but she
always call them sheep.  She makes them go through a
gate, she says; I tried it once, but my gate kept swinging-to
and squeezing the sheep, till I was quite wild with
anxiety and consequently more wakeful than ever."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "But I punished my last old gentleman,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"What did you do?"
</p>

<p>
"When I found that my partner for Saturday's dinner
was older than any of his predecessors, my usually
amiable spirit rebelled."
</p>

<p>
"And what form did the rebellion take?"
</p>

<p>
"I discovered that by breathing hard, when my old
gentleman wasn't looking, I could make the candle-shade
in front of us catch fire whenever I liked.  So when there
came any course that he was particularly keen on, I blew
with my mouth, and the shade blazed.  My poor partner
had to save the women and children by extinguishing the
fire; and while he was engaged in this act of heroism,
the footman&mdash;thinking he had finished&mdash;removed his
plate, and he saw its dainties no more."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever noticed," asked Isabel, as the plates
were being changed, "that the bit of toast underneath a
<i>hors d'Åuvre</i>&mdash;which, mark you, is appointed to be cut by
a little silver fork&mdash;is always of a consistency which would
defy a steam-hammer?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Invariably; and therefore the little silver fork is
usually bent or broken, while the piece of toast springs
unscratched into the air and lands upon the carpet."
</p>

<p>
"You speak feelingly," said Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I have learnt in suffering what I teach in ordinary
conversation.  The fish-fork is also a source of much
distress to me."
</p>

<p>
"How is that?  It never strikes me as an instrument
of destruction."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, it is in this way," explained Miss
Carnaby.  "Some people have fish-forks as well as
fish-knives&mdash;sort of half-bred dessert-forks, don't you
know? with ivory handles.  Now, we don't have these at
home&mdash;we use ordinary silver forks, so I am not prepared for
them."
</p>

<p>
"I see; they take you unawares."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  The consequence is I use a common fork
for my fish; and then, when I get to the second <i>entrÃ©e</i>,
my sin finds me out, and I am left with nothing on my
hands but a large knife and this nasty little half-caste
dessert-fork."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever do you do?" asked the amused Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I fling myself upon the mercy of the man who has
taken me in; and I confess I have never found my
confidence misplaced.  He invariably gives me his own silver
fork, and, if he is a brave man, asks one of the footmen
for another for himself; but if he is only of a normal
courage, he eats his own <i>entrÃ©e</i> with my fish-fork, in
shame and confusion of face."
</p>

<p>
"You might write a book on the Sorrows of Dining,"
suggested Paul.
</p>

<p>
"So I could; at least you and I could do it together."
</p>

<p>
Paul could not help feeling flattered, though he tried
his hardest not.  "I should describe what I have suffered
at the hands of an undermined jelly," he said.  "Don't
you know the horrid, insinuating way the thing has of
curtsying to you; and&mdash;when you respond to its inviting
attitude&mdash;of flinging itself bodily upon your neck, and
burying yourself and it in the common ruins?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed with delight.  "I know exactly.  And
another evil and bitter thing is helping oneself to
strawberries."
</p>

<p>
"When they are in a pyramid, you mean?" said Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and the strawberry at the apex of the pyramid
suffers from suicidal tendencies; and is prone to hurl
itself from its giddy height to perdition, if you so much
as breathe."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.
</p>

<p>
"And its path to destruction," added Miss Carnaby,
"leaves a lurid, crimson stain right across the hostess's
tablecloth."
</p>

<p>
"Like Tennyson's 'Maud,'" said Paul, "when
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Her feet had touched the meadows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left the daisies rosy."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Isabel smiled.  "What an apt quotation!"
</p>

<p>
Paul looked pleased.  "I think our treatise upon the
Sorrows of Dining promises to be a success," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What a pretty girl Violet has grown!" remarked
Isabel, looking down the table at her cousin.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and so like her mother," agreed Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Is she in love with anybody yet, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
Now Paul had a strong suspicion that a certain Lord
Robert Thistletown and Violet were by no means
indifferent to each other; but he was not going to gossip
about the Esdailes, even to Isabel, so he said discreetly:
"I'm sure I can't say.  She would not be very likely to
confide in me even if she were."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not.  But an author like you ought to
discover love stories without having to be told them,
like some people discover water by means of hazel
twigs."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "I am not an author yet," he said.
</p>

<p>
"But, joking apart, you really write a good deal,
don't you, Mr. Seaton?  Uncle Richard tells me that
the delightful and fascinating short stories signed P.S.,
which one comes across now and again in various
magazines, are yours."
</p>

<p>
"They are certainly mine, Miss Carnaby; but I am
afraid that their delightfulness and fascination exist only
in your rose-coloured imagination."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be foolish!  Every one thinks they are
splendid.  You must know you are clever, and I call it
affectation for people to pretend they don't recognize
their own good points.  Now I, for instance, never
pretend that I'm not clever.  If I'd had my choice I'd
rather have been pretty, I confess; but that is neither
here nor there."
</p>

<p>
"It would be useless for you to pretend that you are
not clever; nobody would be taken in.  Clever as you
are, you would not be clever enough for that."
</p>

<p>
"You don't know how clever I am," said Isabel;
"I once succeeded in making a man think I was not
clever."
</p>

<p>
"And what effect did the delusion have upon him?"
</p>

<p>
"He fell in love with me on the spot."
</p>

<p>
"Still he might have done that, even if he'd known
you were clever," suggested Paul.  "There is no limit,
I believe, to the folly of the heart of man in affairs of
this kind.  I daresay he knew you were clever all the
time, and was only a 'deceiver ever' when he pretended
he thought you were not.  Men will forgive even cleverness
in a woman they really care for; you have no idea
how weak they are."
</p>

<p>
"As long as the woman is not cleverer than they are
themselves, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Of course; that goes without saying.  Besides, no
man is so supernaturally humble as to believe that the
cleverest woman in the world is quite as clever as he is
himself.  He only knows that she is cleverer than all his
friends."
</p>

<p>
"If ever I think a man is in danger of thinking me
too clever," said Isabel meditatively, "I always ask him
how to spell a word&mdash;any word will do, provided it is
not too difficult for him.  You can't think how it at
once restores the equilibrium between the sexes.  And
if&mdash;in addition to spelling the word&mdash;he can give you its
derivation, both the man and the scholar stand for ever
vindicated."
</p>

<p>
"That's a good plan," said Paul, "a very good plan.
Now that you mention it, I notice I have often felt
distinct pleasure when a woman has asked me how to
spell a word; and the pleasure has risen to pure joy
when I have superadded the derivation."
</p>

<p>
"But you are wandering from the point," said
Isabel reprovingly.  "I was saying how I liked your
stories, and you were saying that you weren't really
clever."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, Miss Carnaby, you are inaccurate;
what I said, or intended to say, was that I thought I
was so clever that I ought to do something better than
write such stories as those.  Humility is not one of my
many virtues, as you will perceive as you come to know
me better."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't one of mine, either."
</p>

<p>
"No; I'd already perceived that, though I have only
known you for half an hour."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "You are very candid."
</p>

<p>
"Candour has a place, I am glad to say, in my <i>rÃ©pertoire</i>
of excellencies.  I derive much pleasure from the
exercise of it myself, and as no one takes any notice of
my opinion, it really doesn't do any harm."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you feel you ought to write a big book,
instead of sticking to short stories?"
</p>

<p>
"I should like to write a big book," replied Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am sure you can, and therefore I am sure
you will."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked at the speaker appreciatively.  "It is
true that if a man can write a book he will do it sooner
or later; but how did you come to know a thing like
that?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell.  I knew it of myself without being told.
I always say that writing is like flirting; if you can't do
it, nobody can teach you to do it; and if you can do it,
nobody can keep you from doing it."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "You are quite right.  If I don't write
a book it will prove that I can't write a book.  But, all
the same, I hope and believe I can."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I must talk a bit to the man on my other
side," said Isabel.  "I don't want to, but he keeps
clearing his throat like a clock that is going to strike,
and I cannot any longer disregard the sign."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I also ought to exchange pleasure for
duty, and endeavour to converse with the old lady on my
left."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to change new lamps for old, you mean,"
suggested Isabel.  "Allow me to express a hope that the
old one will be as brilliant as the new."
</p>

<p>
"It is unwise to hope for impossibilities, and generally
leads to disappointment," replied Paul.
</p>

<p>
After Paul and Isabel had duly fulfilled their duty to
their neighbours, Isabel said: "You mustn't be in too
great a hurry to begin your book.  Experience, as well
as genius, is required for the writing of books."
</p>

<p>
"That is very true, and that is why I am waiting.  I
don't want to seem conceited, but I am speaking candidly
to you now, and I feel and know I have the power to
write what would be worth reading.  But where I am
weak is in the experience of life.  I have always lived in
a small world, and small worlds&mdash;though perhaps the
most comfortable places of residence&mdash;are not good
training-grounds or seminaries of learning."
</p>

<p>
"My experience is that small worlds and big worlds
are pretty much alike," replied Isabel.  "I have lived in
both, and I don't see much difference."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean that small worlds are really less
interesting than big ones.  Human nature is, of course, the
same in both; and it is human nature that is the most
interesting thing in life.  As you say, the deeper things
are the same in small worlds as in great ones, but their
outer aspects differ in different cases; and the more
cases one sees, the wider are one's sympathies."
</p>

<p>
"But seeing a lot of people is not knowing them,"
objected Isabel.  "We are all more or less like the Man
in the Iron Mask, and take abundant pains to hide our
real faces from our fellows."
</p>

<p>
"Which we have no right to do, in my opinion.  We
are not bound to lay our souls bare for every one to look
at, but as much as we do show ought to be part of our
real selves, and not a mask to put people off the scent.
It seems to me that to take the trouble to conceal
ourselves, argues an exaggerated idea of our own importance."
</p>

<p>
"Which reminds me," said Isabel, "of a funny old
man we once met at a <i>table d'hÃ´te</i>; he told us in strict
confidence that he was the mayor of Little Pettifog, but
begged us not to mention it again as he was travelling
incog."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.  "A most happy instance!  It seems
to me that there are a good many mayors of Little
Pettifog travelling <i>incog.</i>; don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do; and&mdash;like you&mdash;I have no patience with them."
</p>

<p>
"But, on the other hand," said Paul, "I think it is,
as a rule, our own fault if people behave like the Man
in the Iron Mask with us, and proves that we are the
same.  Don't you think that the world is a very fair
mirror, and that people treat us very much as we treat
them?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; and if you are single-minded towards
your friends, and think more of what is due to them than
to you, they in turn will be single-minded towards you,
and think more of what is due to you than to themselves.
At least, that has been my experience so far."
</p>

<p>
"And mine too."
</p>

<p>
"And in the same way if you are time-serving, you
will find other people the same," added Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, when we are very young, we are anxious
that other people should adequately love and fulfil their
duty to us; while, as we grow older, we realize that that
is their part of the business, not ours, and that what we
have to do is to adequately love and fulfil our duty to
them.  This is merely a question of growth, and the
development of a sense of proportion."
</p>

<p>
"I believe in human nature as a whole.  I have
trusted a good many people more or less, and none of
them as yet have ever failed me," Isabel said.
</p>

<p>
"And never will as long as you trust them," added
Paul; "but only when you begin to doubt them."
</p>

<p>
"I quite agree with you there.  Again, I do not a bit
mind being laughed at; in fact, if the joke is a good one,
I am ready to join in it; so I generally show my real self
to people, and am not afraid of what is called 'giving
myself away'.  Consequently people as a rule show their
real selves to me."
</p>

<p>
"It is a great mistake to be afraid of 'giving oneself
away'.  I don't know a more paralyzing form of fear."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," replied Isabel, "that life is very
much like swimming or skating; one has to let oneself go
before one can get on at all."
</p>

<p>
"And we have all got to be ourselves.  The best
possible edition of ourselves, I admit; but still ourselves,
and not anybody else; and therefore we must expand
along our own lines, and not along other people's."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember the duchess's baby in <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i>, who 'made a very ugly baby but a very
handsome pig'?  Now so many people are like that;
they make stupendous efforts to become ugly babies,
instead of settling down comfortably as handsome
pigs."
</p>

<p>
"Milton's Satan was wiser in his generation than
the children of light," remarked Paul; "he preferred
ruling as a handsome pig to serving as an ugly baby, if
you remember; only he put the case in more forceful
words.  Still the sentiment is the same.  But he was
not supposed to take the highest view."
</p>

<p>
"But wouldn't you rather be the ruling pig than the
serving baby?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I would; but that doesn't make it right."
</p>

<p>
"Still you said just now that we must be ourselves
and not anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"And I say so still, Miss Carnaby; but one must not
press the rule too far.  We must, of course, live our own
lives and cultivate our own characters, and must not try
to grow roses on apple-trees nor lilies on oaks.  But our
healthy desire for individuality must not carry us into
the error of becoming a law unto ourselves, and doing
whatsoever is right in our own eyes."
</p>

<p>
"I think I see what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"I speak from experience," continued Paul; "as I
told you, I was brought up in a narrow world, and also in
a very religious one; and I was taught that few things
were right and that many things were wrong, and that
we must all try and conform ourselves to the same
pattern.  As I grew older, and saw more of the world,
I found that this view of life was too narrow a one, and
then I joined in the modern worship of Individuality and
the glorification of Humanity; and I abused all law and
order because they tended to cramp and conform the
individual.  Now a second reaction has set in; and I see
that the Truth lies half way between the two extremes&mdash;as,
in fact, it generally does."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes glistened; Paul interested her extremely.
"Then you mean that one must be the master of one's
individuality, and not its slave?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Or in better words, 'As free, and not using your
liberty for a cloke of maliciousness,'" answered Paul;
"you see, the highest life is a life of contradictions, and
this is merely one of them."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about your own people," said Isabel
impulsively, "I'm sure they must be nice."
</p>

<p>
And Paul, to his surprise, found himself telling Miss
Carnaby all about his father and his mother and Joanna,
and his life at Oxford, and his boating; and his struggle
to get on, and his dreams of fame.  And Isabel seemed
to understand it all as thoroughly as he did himself.
</p>

<p>
Paul had never talked so well in his life before.  He
admired Miss Carnaby enough to desire above all things
to make a good impression on her; and he was not yet
sufficiently in love with her to be awkward and
tongue-tied in her presence.  When a man admires without
loving, he is conversationally at his best.  There comes
a later stage when he utters banalities, and makes inane
jokes, and inwardly curses himself for appearing such an
ass in the sight of the prettiest eyes in the world; and
he has no idea that the prettiest eyes in the world see
through a stone wall as far as most people, and very
much prefer this style of conversation to rounded
sentences and finished periods.
</p>

<p>
As Paul sat smoking in his own room that night he
said to himself: "I never saw a woman with such blue
eyes in my life."
</p>

<p>
Which was not true; he had seen scores of women
with equally blue eyes, but he had never taken the
trouble to notice them.
</p>

<p>
Then he mused, his thoughts still running on Isabel:
"Think of calling such a girl as that vain!  She isn't a
bit vain.  It is the other women that are so beastly
jealous of her!"
</p>

<p>
Which also was not true; Isabel was extremely vain,
and Paul had already done his best to make her more so;
but his eyes were blinded that he could not see.

CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
Elton Manor.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Love," she said, "is just a game<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does for summer weather!"<br>
  "Love," he answered, "is a flame<br>
  Putting lesser lights to shame:<br>
  Making wealth and rank and fame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weigh lighter than a feather!"<br>
  "Sure," she cried, "we mean the same;<br>
  Love is but a fancy name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you and me together."<br>
</p>

<p>
When Paul Seaton and Dick Esdaile were
respectively twenty-six and thirteen, the
former was offered the post of editor to the
new magazine, <i>The Pendulum</i>, and the latter
was considered fit to enter Eton.  So Paul concluded
his pleasant life at Esdaile Court and went to live in
London, to prepare himself the more fully for that great
book he meant to write some day.  By that time his
friendship with Miss Carnaby was an established factor
in his existence.  Paul called it friendship, because he
was as yet too poor to call it by any other name; but
the other name was ready, as soon as Paul had secured
a sufficient status and income to allow him to rechristen
the sentiment.  He was very glad to take up his abode
in London.  But, there again, London was only a euphemism
for Isabel.  Living in London meant seeing Isabel
frequently; therefore London was the most desirable
place of residence under the sun.
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley was always "at home" on Thursday
afternoons, and consequently Thursday became Paul's
Sabbath.  He called as often as he dared; and when he
felt it but decent to allow a Thursday to elapse without
his dropping in at Prince's Gate, he sympathized with
the Irish peasant who said: "His Riverence is going to
Dublin Fair, so there will be no Sunday this week".
</p>

<p>
And Isabel also measured time by Thursday afternoons,
and felt such seasons a blank indeed if they did
not bring Paul.  She waited till he arrived before she
ordered up the second brew of tea, and she took care to
pour his cup out first; she talked to him for as much
time as she could spare from other visitors; and listened
to him all the time that she was conversing with them,
and he was talking to somebody else; she introduced him
only to clever men and to plain women; and, in short,
she generally behaved herself as all right-minded and
right-mannered young women do under similar circumstances.
She derived almost as much happiness as Paul
did from their friendship; but she pretended that she
did not know that friendship was only a <i>nom de plume</i>;
all the same, she could have found the right name in the
dictionary with her eyes shut.
</p>

<p>
Tickets of admission into Eden are variously worded;
and Paul Seaton received one&mdash;after he had been for a
year or so editor of <i>The Pendulum</i>&mdash;couched in the
following terms:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"DEAR MR. SEATON,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Sir Benjamin, Isabel and I leave town on
the 10th, and we shall be so pleased to see you if you will run
down to Farley Castle on the following Saturday, and spend the
Sunday with us.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "Yours very truly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"CAROLINE FARLEY."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Paul arrived at Farley Castle on that blissful
and broiling Saturday afternoon, he found a distinguished
company drinking tea upon the lawn.  The Esdailes were
there, with Violet; and there was a Peer and a Cabinet
Minister; also Lord Robert Thistletown, a younger son
of the Marquis of Wallingford; likewise Miss Ethel
Gordon, a celebrated beauty; and one or two others,
that merely served as padding.
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley duly presented Paul to her other guests,
and he sat down to be refreshed in (and by) their company.
</p>

<p>
"That is a capital article of yours on art and education
in the current number of <i>The Pendulum</i>, Seaton," remarked
Sir Benjamin, after a due discussion of the heat
of the weather and the lateness of Saturday trains.
</p>

<p>
"It is very kind of you to say so," replied Paul, "but
I felt it was far too large a subject to be treated in so
small a space, and my limits handicapped me a good deal."
</p>

<p>
"I also read it with much interest," said Lord Wrexham,
"though I fear I did not agree with it all.  It
appears to me that we require education to make us
understand art, rather than that art is in itself an
education."
</p>

<p>
Paul shook his head.  "Of course education helps us
with technique; but I think that art itself is independent
of education.  The artist, like the poet, is born, not
made."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you mean to say," asked Lord Wrexham,
"that the artist of to-day is none the better for the art
produced in the centuries that lie behind him?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a richer man," replied Paul, "but not, I
think, a better artist.  There is no heritage in art, as
there is in science.  The artist is complete in himself,
without ancestors or successors."
</p>

<p>
"Like Melchizedek," suggested Sir Benjamin.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," said Paul, "but the man of science, on
the contrary, builds on foundations which his predecessors
have laid, and reaps what they have sown."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are about right," remarked Mr. Kesterton,
the Cabinet Minister, "an ordinary plumber now knows
more than Galileo did, and a chemist's assistant more
than Jenner: but our innumerable host of minor poets
have not yet out-Shakespeared Shakespeare, nor do our
modern impressionists put Raphael and Michael Angelo
to shame."
</p>

<p>
"Still some of the modern pictures are very pretty,
don't you think?" chimed in Lady Esdaile, "and so
much more interesting than the old ones.  Do you know,
I get rather tired of nothing but Madonnas and Holy
Families?  Of course they are very nice in their way,
and devout and religious and all that; but if I had to
choose a picture, I'd much rather have a hunting scene
or a railway station or a Scotch moor."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kesterton did not answer.  Some men, he felt,
were appointed to govern kingdoms, and some to talk to
silly women; but no man could reasonably be expected
to do both.
</p>

<p>
"My lady's tastes are modern," said Sir Richard,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they are," agreed Sir Richard's wife.  "I'd
rather read a new novel than all Shakespeare's things put
together; and I enjoy Gilbert and Sullivan far more than
Handel and Mozart."
</p>

<p>
"So do I, Lady Esdaile," chimed in Lord Robert
Thistletown.  "I am 'the heir of all the ages in the
foremost files of time,' and I cannot waste my time in looking
back, like Lot's wife."
</p>

<p>
"But if, as you say, the artist is born not made, how
can art be an education?" inquired Lord Wrexham.
</p>

<p>
"Art is really the interpretation of nature," replied
Paul; "therefore the artist has the power to reveal
to others what he alone has the eyes to discover for
himself.  He will not teach other men to be artists;
he will only show them what he has seen.  Do I make
myself clear, Lord Wrexham?  I know what I mean, but
I am afraid I put it rather badly."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all; I quite grasp your meaning," said his
lordship graciously, "though I am not yet sure that I
concur with it."
</p>

<p>
"If art is an integral part of a good education, as
Mr. Seaton asserts," remarked Mr. Kesterton, "we shall
have to spend more money on public picture-galleries;
and how the Exchequer of the future will stand it,
goodness only knows.  I am thankful to think that by that
time I shall be where budgets cease from troubling."
</p>

<p>
"I am going to write an article for <i>The Pendulum</i> on
love as education&mdash;a sort of opposition shop to
Mr. Seaton's school of art," said Isabel Carnaby.  "There is
really nothing so admirable from an educational point of
view as the process known as 'falling in love'; and I
consider that a Government that makes education
compulsory, ought to insist upon every one's falling in love at
least once before he or she is five-and-twenty.  I should
call it 'passing the seventh standard,' seven being the
perfect number, you know."
</p>

<p>
"A capital idea, my dear young lady!" said
Mr. Kesterton graciously, for Isabel always amused him.
"Should you erect special schools for the purpose, may
I ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, gorgeous red and white palaces, like the
board-schools; and they would be called 'Highest Grade
Schools,' and I should superintend them myself."
</p>

<p>
"And no one better qualified!  Is it impertinent to ask
if you would combine the office of object with that of
instructress?"
</p>

<p>
"Not necessarily.  Of course it is better for men to
fall in love with me than with any one else&mdash;teaches them
more, I mean, and bores them less.  But I shouldn't
make it a <i>sine quÃ¢ non</i>.  I should advise it, but not insist
upon it.  If they preferred to do so, the pupils might fall
in love with somebody else; but it would be like learning
literary style from <i>The Polite Letter Writer</i>, instead of
from the classics."
</p>

<p>
"I should undertake the girls' department," cried Lord
Robert, "it is more than a liberal education to a woman
to fall in love with me&mdash;it includes all the extras, and a
year's finishing abroad into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I'm not so sure about that."
</p>

<p>
"It is so.  When a girl falls in love with me, she
realizes at once that brains and beauty and wealth are
mere worthless and vulgar attributes; but that a heart
of gold, beating under a pocket of very small silver,
is the only thing really worthy of a woman's regard.
This has a most elevating and refining effect on their
dear little characters, bless 'em!  It has indeed!
Therefore I shall put aside my constitutional shyness, and
undertake the girls' department of the 'Highest Grade
School'."
</p>

<p>
"You have no constitutional shyness to put aside,
Lord Bobby," said Lady Farley; "so your sacrifice to
the common weal is not so stupendous after all."
</p>

<p>
"How you misjudge me!" sighed Lord Robert.  "It
is ever my fate to be misjudged by my dearest and best!
Shyness is my bane, my besetment; and it is only my
exquisite unselfishness which enables me to overcome it
as I do, in order to make other people happy by the
uninterrupted flow of my improving conversation.  And
this is all the thanks I get."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose everybody feels shy sometimes," said
Miss Carnaby.
</p>

<p>
"Not everybody," argued Lord Robert, "take my
word for it, you never do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes I do, under certain circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"When? do tell us," besought Violet Esdaile.
</p>

<p>
Isabel thought for a moment.  "I am shy of people
who make me feel things," she replied slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean you feel shy of a man if you think
he is going to make you an offer, or to pull one of
your teeth out?" inquired Lord Robert with friendly
interest.
</p>

<p>
"Roughly speaking, yes."
</p>

<p>
"That's a pity!  Because in either case it is sport
to them, you see; so it is unfortunate if it is death to
you."
</p>

<p>
Isabel smiled.  "My dear Lord Bobby, how absurd
you are!  Now perhaps you will respond to my
confidence, and tell us when you feel shy."
</p>

<p>
Bobby thought for a moment.  "When my boots
creak," he answered.
</p>

<p>
Everybody laughed.  "It is no laughing matter, I
can assure you," he continued.  "I've got a pair now
that make me feel as timid as an unfledged school-girl
every time I put them on.  I wore them to go to church
only last Sunday; and they sang such a processional
hymn to themselves all the way up the aisle, that by
the time I reached our pew I was half dead with shame,
and 'the beauty born of murmuring sound' had 'passed
into my face'; but it wasn't the type of beauty that was
becoming to me&mdash;it was too anxious and careworn for
my <i>retroussÃ©</i> style."
</p>

<p>
"Weren't your people awfully ashamed of you?"
asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"There were none of them there except my mother;
and she sat at the far end of the pew, and tried to look
as if I were only a collateral."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if your mother ever feels shy?" remarked
Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Dreadfully, of her own maid.  She has had her
for a long time; and I believe that when a maid has
had a right of way across your head for over seven
years, she can do your hair in what style she likes and
you may not interfere.  That, I am told, is the law with
regard to rights of way."
</p>

<p>
"Do you ever feel shy?" inquired Isabel of Mr. Kesterton.
</p>

<p>
"Only when I'm introduced to babies, and their
mothers look as if they expected me to kiss them&mdash;to
kiss the babies, I mean&mdash;not the mothers; that would
not make me feel nearly so shy.  I am always being
godfather to the terrible little things, and giving them
spoons; but I confine myself to the silver variety."
</p>

<p>
"Are you many godfathers?"
</p>

<p>
"This is what I am, Miss Carnaby.  I am one
husband, three fathers, nine grandfathers and seventeen
godfathers&mdash;thirty gentlemen in one, so ten times
better than Cerberus.  And what it costs me in presents
is something fabulous."
</p>

<p>
Isabel turned to Lord Wrexham.  "When are you shy?"
</p>

<p>
"Always.  I invariably feel that I am boring people,
and this makes me bore them all the more."
</p>

<p>
"And you, Uncle Benjamin?"
</p>

<p>
"When I go out shooting, my dear.  I am a bad
shot at best; and, knowing this, I am consequently
generally at my worst."
</p>

<p>
"My governor is a first-rate shot," announced Lord
Robert proudly.  "I know no young man who is equal
to him; but I'm a poor hand at the job myself.
Now-a-days fathers shoot better than their sons, as a rule, I
think; a proof of the decadence of the race.  (That's a
good sentence!  I shall wait till you have all forgotten
it, and then make use of it again.)  Does your father
shoot much?" he inquired, turning to Paul.
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "My father is a Methodist minister,"
he said, "so he knows nothing about sport."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, how queer!" exclaimed Ethel Gordon,
looking at Paul with as much curiosity as if he had said
his father was a giraffe; but Lord Robert came to the
rescue.  "I've got an uncle in that line of business," he
remarked airily, "at least he is a bishop; and he is the
best old chap I ever met in my life&mdash;a regular saint,
don't you know?  I daresay your governor is the same."
</p>

<p>
"He is a good man," answered Paul simply.
</p>

<p>
"So is my Uncle Ambrose; and there is nothing like
it after all.  It takes time, you bet, to be as good as that;
but it pays in the long run.  I wish you knew my uncle;
you'd like him.  He gives away everything he has to
charity, and he really cares for nothing in the world but
how to make other folks better and happier.  He is the
Bishop of Ditchester."
</p>

<p>
"I know Lord Ambrose Thistletown by name, of
course, well," said Paul.
</p>

<p>
"It is a beastly see," continued Bobby, "all smoke
and manufactures and working men, and things of that
kind.  They have offered him better ones, but he will
stay on there because he thinks he can do more good
among poor people than among rich ones; and I guess
he is about right."
</p>

<p>
"That is very noble of him!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! he is like that all through; a regular good sort,
out and out; but his wife is simply awful.  She is always
worrying him to go to a place where there would be a
bigger palace, and more swagger friends for her; and she
is for ever preaching to the poor old man about the
claims of birth, and the duties of rank, and rot of that
sort."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Lord Ambrose!" said Isabel sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"She is simply sickening," continued Bobby, "when
she gets on her high horse, and rates the bishop for not
properly fulfilling the duties of his position and the
claims of his station; she feels those claims so strongly
herself, she says, that she should consider it a sin to
disregard them.  She was the daughter of an archdeacon,
you know," and Bobby chuckled to himself.
</p>

<p>
"She can't bear me," said Lady Esdaile, "she thinks
I am worldly because I wear a fringe, and dance round-dances.
And so she gives me a cheap and religious little
book every time she meets me."
</p>

<p>
Lord Bobby clapped his hands with delight.  "I
know them," he cried.  "The <i>Mammon Worshippers</i> and
<i>Outlandish Women</i> are two of her 'choicest gifts in store';
but she has plenty of others for those who need them.
What irritates me in the woman is that she is such a
toady; she dismisses her servants without characters if
she finds they are not strict teetotalers; and yet once,
when that horrid Lord Watertight was regularly drunk
at a party, she said it was his animal spirits only that
carried him away, and that he was a most lovable young
man.  Spirits carried him away, I confess, but they were
vegetable and not animal ones."
</p>

<p>
"That was just like her," said Lady Esdaile.
</p>

<p>
"She not only believes that the king can do no
wrong, but that the peerage can do no wrong, either&mdash;which
is carrying a good principle to an untenable extreme,"
continued Lord Bobby.  "But did you ever hear
the poem that Lady Eleanor Gregory wrote about her?"
</p>

<p>
"No; was it very smart?" asked Lady Farley.
"Eleanor's verses generally are."
</p>

<p>
"Awfully good.  I wish I could repeat it to you, but
I can only remember one verse.  This is it:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A bishop must not revel in strong drink;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he may take a little, I have heard,<br>
  Just for the sake of&mdash;no, I do not think<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It maidenly to use the Pauline word:<br>
  I only say he'll take some, should there cease<br>
  To be beneath his apron perfect peace."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Everybody was amused and Mr. Kesterton shouted
with laughter.  "Capital," he cried, "capital!  Lady
Eleanor is a clever little girl.  But it is a pity she does
not confine herself to penning humorous verses, instead
of indulging in the love-sick ditties we frequently read in
the magazines above her signature."
</p>

<p>
"Still she can write good poetry," remarked Paul.
</p>

<p>
"That may be; but I don't like young ladies to wear
the willow in print in that fashion.  I may be
old-fashioned, but that is my opinion."
</p>

<p>
"And mine too," agreed Lord Wrexham.
</p>

<p>
"I expect her willow is an artificial flower," said
Isabel, "or she would not wave it before the public eye.
The people who have really felt things don't write about
them."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't you think the faithless swain of her
poems is a real person?" wondered Ethel Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"I once asked her if he was," answered Lord Robert.
"Everybody was asking the question behind her back, I
told her, and I thought it a more effective plan to ask it
before her face."
</p>

<p>
"And what did she say?  Was she angry with you?"
inquired Miss Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"Not she; she merely laughed, and said she had
drawn a beau at a venture, and it was therefore only a
fancy portrait."
</p>

<p>
"Very smart again," murmured Mr. Kesterton approvingly.
"Girls who can make jokes like that ought
not to waste their time reeling out poetry as easily as if
they were ravelling an old stocking.  They should leave
that to the dull, sentimental women, who wear their
hearts on their sleeves and their curls down their backs."
</p>

<p>
"Was Lady Ambrose very furious at the poem?"
asked Lady Esdaile.  "It was just the sort of thing to
make her mad if any one but a ladyship had written it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think she ever saw it," replied Bobby, "but
the bishop did, and enjoyed it immensely.  He loves a
joke, does the dear old bishop, and loves it all the more
if his wife is out of it.  I remember that she was
described therein as 'a godly Venus, rising from the sea';
and my father has called Lady A. 'the godly Venus' ever
since."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kesterton chuckled appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
"What I can't stand is humbug," continued Lord
Robert, "and when I see that woman ready to sell what
she is pleased to call her soul for money and position and
all that, and then hear her jawing against Mammon and
worldliness and things of that sort, it makes me feel
positively sick."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled, and could not help thinking of
Mrs. Martin.  He remembered a tale he had once heard of
some Staffordshire colliers who went to see the sights of
London, and their surprise reached its height when one
exclaimed: "I say, Bill, they've got the same old moon
here as we've got at Tipton!"  The sights of London
are still very wonderful and well worth seeing; but they've
got the same old human nature there as they've got at
Tipton, and everywhere else under the sun.
</p>

<p>
That "week-end" was a season of perfect bliss to
Paul; partly because he was in the company of some of
the best-mannered and most brilliant people in England
but principally because Isabel Carnaby was nice to him.
He carried her prayer-book to church for her on Sunday
morning, and the scent of Russia-leather sent a thrill
through him all his life afterwards; while the sound of her
voice in the hymns made those particular psalms stand
out from the rest of <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i> for ever
in Paul Seaton's ears.
</p>

<p>
On their way back from church, Isabel asked him if
he had begun to write his book.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," answered he, "you know you told me
not to be in a hurry, and I've taken your advice.  I
feel I am decidedly mellower than I was, but I'm not yet
ripe."
</p>

<p>
"Shall you write under your own name?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  If you write under your own name you cannot
help being handicapped, to some extent, by your
circumstances and surroundings.  You know what your friends
will expect of you, and you feel bound in some measure
to fulfil their expectations.  But if you write under a
<i>nom de plume</i> you are quite free."
</p>

<p>
"I see what you mean, and I think I agree with you,"
said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"For instance, I should say lots of things that my
father would not agree with, my opinions on most matters
being different from his, though my admiration and
respect for his character are greater than they ever were.
He has found truth and righteousness, and I hope
to find them some day; but I shall travel by
different roads and use different methods from those by
which he has been led.  Mind you, I do not say, or even
think, that mine are better than his, but they are
different, owing to the difference in our characters and our
generations."
</p>

<p>
"I perfectly understand," said Isabel sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Then, do you see? if I wrote as his son, he would
have to bear in a measure the onus of my work, and that
would not be fair to him."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right.  But do not wait too long
before you begin your book; do not wait till you are
<i>blasÃ©</i> and cynical and have lost all your illusions."
</p>

<p>
"Do you like people to keep their illusions?" Paul
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, oh! yes.  I always pray that I may never outlive
my illusions or my front teeth, though all else may
fail me."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.  Then he said more seriously: "It seems
to me that the more you see of the world and men and
things, and the better you understand them, the less
cynical you ought to be.  I believe that <i>tout comprendre
est tout pardonner</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad to hear you say that!  It is what I
have always thought."
</p>

<p>
"It disgusts me," continued Paul, "that when people
tell you to look at anything as a man of the world, they
mean you are to take the most disagreeable view possible."
</p>

<p>
"I know."
</p>

<p>
"When you begin life, you think that everything is
rose-colour; this is crude.  You find that some things
are not rose-colour, and then you think that everything
is blue-mouldy; this also is crude.  But when you have
really seen life and the world, you know that some things
are rose-colour and some are blue-mouldy, and that the
majority are neither one nor the other.  To me the
blue-mouldy stage is only one degree less raw and crude than
the rose-colour one, and much more objectionable."
</p>

<p>
"How well you put things!" exclaimed Isabel.  "You
seem to think all the thoughts which I have thought, but
have struggled in vain to express; but you are able also
to express them.  And one grand thing about you is that
you always say all that you think."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "Not quite all."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that there are Bluebeard's chambers
in your heart that even I have not looked into."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But I want to look in," persisted Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't&mdash;yet."
</p>

<p>
"Can I ever?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  It depends on whether you are
willing to wait or not.  But, as you said to me, you
mustn't be in a hurry," replied Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I know most of your heart and mind; but this, I
suppose, is an additional exhibition, like the chamber of
horrors at Madame Tussaud's; and one has to pay six-pence
extra to see it."
</p>

<p>
"Only it isn't a chamber of horrors, and sixpence
isn't enough."
</p>

<p>
"But I've got more than sixpence."
</p>

<p>
"I know you have, Miss Carnaby, but I haven't; and
it is I who have to pay this entrance-fee.  That is why I
am saving up my money, and editing magazines, and
writing stupid stories."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I should be interested if I ever did
see it?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"But what do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"You might, or you might not," replied Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow you might tell me what it is like.  Do tell
me what it is like, dear Mr. Seaton."
</p>

<p>
Paul thought for a moment.  "It is rather like an
ordinary looking-glass," he said, "in fact you couldn't
tell the difference."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "How silly you are!"
</p>

<p>
"In some things; but not in this."
</p>

<p>
"There is the gong!" exclaimed Isabel.  "We are late."
</p>

<p>
At lunch that day Lord Wrexham took upon himself
to expound to Paul a new system of surface-drainage,
whereof he thought most highly; and so Paul did not
again get word with Isabel, till they two started for a
walk across the park in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
"Lord Wrexham was terribly agrarian to-day, wasn't
he?" said Isabel.  "He is awfully boring when he begins
to explain things."
</p>

<p>
"But he is a nice man," answered Paul; "and he
would be really interesting to listen to, if a fellow wasn't
wanting to talk to you all the time instead."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I find him dreadfully tiresome when he becomes
agricultural and explanatory."
</p>

<p>
"You really ought not to abuse him, for he admires
you most tremendously."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shrugged her shoulders.  "I know he does;
men of that age always do.  I shouldn't be surprised if
you admired me when you are as old as Lord Wrexham."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't, either," said Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I think I should rather like it if you did."
</p>

<p>
"Should you?  then I'll try.  I always try to do what
you want, you know, however difficult it may be."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "I am fond of admiration," she said.
</p>

<p>
"So I should have supposed."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not one of those tiresome, exacting women,
who are always longing to be first with everybody.  I
can't stand the sort of women who suffer from what they
call 'heart-hunger'.  Can you?"
</p>

<p>
"They are pretty bad," agreed Paul.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not like that, am I?"
</p>

<p>
"No; you like people to admire you, and you take a
good deal of trouble to ensure this result: but you are not
in the least <i>exigeante</i>.  I don't think you'd expect to be
first with a person unless that person was first with you;
and then, of course, you'd have a right to expect it."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true; how well you understand me!
I don't want men to go in jeopardy of their lives by
fetching water for me from the wells of Bethlehem; but I do
want them to be ready and willing to take me down to
supper at balls, and to bring me refreshments at evening
parties."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "You appear to be a wonderfully
reasonable woman."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you think that!  I always consider my
'sweet reasonableness' one of my strong points."
</p>

<p>
"But it is only because you don't really care," continued
Paul, "the minute you begin to care, you'll be as
unreasonable as the rest of them."
</p>

<p>
Isabel frowned.  "How horrid you are!"
</p>

<p>
"Am I?  I'm sorry for that.  But it grieves my
righteous soul to see you hugging your negligences and
ignorances, and mistaking them for virtues."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you were not so nasty!" sighed Isabel;
"when you are as nasty as this, it makes a walk with
you a toil instead of a pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't make it a danger instead of a toil; which
you will do if you walk on that damp grass."
</p>

<p>
"I shall walk on the damp grass as long as you are
disagreeable."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you wouldn't," and Paul's face grew quite
anxious.  "You'll be certain to catch cold if you do,
and I do so hate you to have a cold.  I can see your
feet are quite wet already."  And then Paul smiled
to himself, remembering how Edgar Ford had once said:
"A man must be at a woman's feet before he knows when
they are getting wet, and is ready to lay his cloak across
the puddles to keep them dry."
</p>

<p>
"I shall walk in the damp till you leave off being
disagreeable," persisted Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it that you want me to say?"
</p>

<p>
"I want you to say that you think I am a most
reasonable woman&mdash;not that I only appear to be."
</p>

<p>
"I can't say that, for it wouldn't be true; but I don't
mind saying that I think a reasonable woman the most
tiresome and detestable being under heaven."
</p>

<p>
And then Isabel came off the grass.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you thought better of me!" she said, with a
sigh.
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.  "I'm very glad I don't.  It is quite
enough for me as it is, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"I mean, I wish you said pretty things to me, like
other men do."
</p>

<p>
"But I am nothing if not original."
</p>

<p>
"It seems very unfortunate," murmured Isabel, "that
you are the only man that I want to say pretty things to
me, and that therefore you won't say them."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Miss Carnaby, you are confusing cause
and effect.  I do not refrain from saying pretty things
because you want me to say them, but you want me to
say them because I refrain."
</p>

<p>
"Why are you so fond of making me cross?" asked
Isabel with a pout.
</p>

<p>
"Because it is the most amusing form of sport I
know.  I used to think that rowing and fishing ran it
close, but now I have decided that making you cross is
the most fascinating pastime in the world&mdash;bar one."
</p>

<p>
"You've never tried the other."
</p>

<p>
"I know I've not.  Probably that is why I still retain
such a high opinion of it."
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure that it would amuse you if you did
try it."
</p>

<p>
"Neither am I," replied Paul, "but I'm not going to
try it till I am quite sure that it would not amuse you."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't you like to see me enjoying myself?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, within reasonable limits.  I like to see
children enjoying themselves, but there are some things
that I should refuse to give them as playthings."
</p>

<p>
"But you would give those things to the children
when they were old enough to appreciate them," said
Isabel coaxingly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"How soon do you think I shall be old enough to
appreciate things?"
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "Perhaps when you have grown tired
of living on refreshments at evening parties, and want
some water from the well of Bethlehem for a change."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you despise me for liking refreshments at
evening parties?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least; but I think it is rather a youthful
taste, like currant wine or raspberry vinegar.  There will
come a time when it won't satisfy you, and then you
will cry out for living water from the well at
Bethlehem&mdash;which, by the way, was your metaphor, not mine;
but it expresses what I mean."
</p>

<p>
"And what will happen then?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that I can't say.  It will depend upon whether
any one out of the legions who have lackeyed you and
taken you down to countless ball-suppers, is ready
to go in jeopardy of his life for you; and that only time
can show."
</p>

<p>
Isabel thought for a moment.  "There is rather a
good lesson for all women in our well-metaphor, isn't
there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Paul.  "Women, as a rule, make
such dreadful mistakes.  You see, nothing but love will
really satisfy a woman in the long run; and unattractive
women, as a rule, acknowledge this.  But attractive
women get such a lot of admiration that they think at
first that admiration will satisfy them."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  Admiration is like porridge&mdash;awfully
stodging, but you get hungry again almost as soon as
you've eaten it."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  Therefore," continued Paul, "an attractive
woman is more likely to make this mistake than an
unattractive one; yet when the time comes that her
heart cries out for reality, she will need it quite as much
as her less-admired sister, though probably by that time
she will have thrown it away, and not be able to find it
again.  The unattractive woman, on the other hand,
treasures up every bit of love she receives, and makes
the most of it."
</p>

<p>
"I see; it is a serious thing to be an attractive
woman after all," said Isabel thoughtfully.  Then she
looked up at Paul and smiled.  "But it would be worse
to be an unattractive one, wouldn't it?  Oh! you don't
think I ever shall be, do you, Mr. Seaton&mdash;not even
when I'm old and grey?  Please say you don't."
</p>

<p>
And Paul said it; and said it several times; and,
what is more, he meant what he said.

CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
Indecision.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Do I love you?  Can I prove you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than all the world to me?<br>
  Thus I ponder, and I wonder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What my true reply must be.<br>
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, early in the season following
Paul's visit to Elton Manor, he and Isabel
were seated under a tree in Kensington
Gardens.  It was one of those days when
spring pretends that it is summer, and the parks pretend
that they are the country, and all the world pretends that
it is young again: nevertheless Paul's face was very
serious.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Carnaby," he said, "I want to speak to you."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shrugged her shoulders.  "I'm sorry for that;
and you look such a 'potent, grave and reverend seignior,'
that I feel certain you are going to say something
disagreeable.  Now do think twice before you speak."
</p>

<p>
"I have thought twice&mdash;and twice a million times over."
</p>

<p>
"Twice a million times over&mdash;I wonder how much that
is.  I cannot do the sum myself, I am such a poor adder&mdash;or
ought I to say a poor addist?  A poor adder sounds
so poisonous and serpenty, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
But Paul would not laugh.  "Won't you listen to
me?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I have no alternative, as you have paid
the penny for my chair, and I am partaking of your
hospitality for the time being.  But it really is a pity to
use up such a lovely afternoon in speaking seriously;
serious speaking&mdash;like bagatelle&mdash;ought to be reserved
as an amusement for wet days."
</p>

<p>
"I really want to speak to you," persisted Paul, "I
am not joking."
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir, I never for a moment imagined you
were.  Your expression just now would grace a mute at
a funeral.  And yet you take the trouble to inform me
that you are not joking.  You might as well have taken
the trouble to inform me that you were not swimming, or
painting, or driving a cab."
</p>

<p>
"It really isn't kind of you to go on like this, Miss
Carnaby."
</p>

<p>
"And it really isn't kind of you to spoil such a lovely
afternoon by speaking seriously."
</p>

<p>
Paul did not answer, so Isabel rattled on: "Now you
are sulking, and if there is one thing I hate more than
another it is a sulky temper.  I'd rather have a squint
than a sulky temper any day.  Besides, dark men should
never look sulky, it isn't becoming to them; it gives a
lurid, thundery sort of expression to their faces."
</p>

<p>
Paul still remained silent, but Isabel did not dare to
do so for a moment.  "Isn't it a jolly afternoon?" she
continued; "and these gardens look perfectly lovely.
But I hope it isn't going to be too hot for the Wallingfords'
ball next week.  I can't bear a hot ball-room; your
face gets so red, and your fringe goes out of curl, and
altogether you look like one of Turner's sunsets in the
National Gallery.  At least I do, and I can't bear to feel
I'm looking like a sunset.  Why don't you smile when a
lady talks to you?  It is positively refrigerating to talk to
a man with an expression like yours.  Why don't you
smile like a little gentleman, as the nursemaids around us
would say?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I am not amused."
</p>

<p>
"That is very rude of you!  And you are generally
such a prettily behaved person.  You don't seem to be
listening to me, either."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not," said Paul, "I'm thinking about something else."
</p>

<p>
"Fie, fie, Master Seaton! whatever will your mamma
say when you get home?" cried Isabel, shaking her finger
at him.
</p>

<p>
"When you have quite finished I should like to have
my innings," said Paul grimly, "but I don't in the least
wish to hurry you."
</p>

<p>
"You are the most unappreciative man I ever talked to!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Miss Carnaby, it isn't fair to treat a
fellow like this.  Will you listen to me or will you
not? because if you won't I'm going away."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked to see if he were in earnest; when Paul
was in earnest she knew by experience other people had
to be in earnest too.
</p>

<p>
"All right," she sighed.  "Say your say."
</p>

<p>
Paul's face grew very white.  "I never made love to
a woman before, and I never shall again, so I am a poor
hand at the business.  But you know how I love you;
and I want to know if you will be my wife."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Seaton!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell you what you are to me," continued
Paul; "but you know as well as I do that I've cared for
nothing in the world but you ever since that evening at
Esdaile.  You have seen how I have hungered for a
kind word from you, and how I have starved when it
pleased your whim to withhold it from me.  You have
seen all this and it has amused you.  But I think it
has done something more than amuse you, or else I
shouldn't be speaking like this to you to-day.  Am I
right, Isabel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to speak yet, but I simply cannot go
on like this any longer.  The thought of you comes
between me and everything else, till I cannot carry on
my work or do my duty for thinking of you.  Sometimes
I think you really care a bit, and then I am lifted up to
heaven; and sometimes I think you have merely been
playing with me all the time, and then I am plunged in
the depths of despair.  I must know one way or the
other.  This suspense is killing me."
</p>

<p>
"Poor boy!" said Isabel gently.
</p>

<p>
"No; I don't want your pity or your friendship.  I
want your love or nothing at all.  If I cannot have that,
I must do my best to put you out of my life altogether.
I will not go on like this."
</p>

<p>
"Still our friendship is very nice," said Isabel
weakly.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't enough for me.  It unsettles me and takes
away my peace of mind, without giving me happiness in
return.  I feel that I could do anything with you to help
me; I feel I could do something without you altogether;
but I know I can do nothing as long as I am tortured by
seeing daily my heart's desire, and not knowing if it can
ever be mine or not."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder my friendship doesn't please you more,"
said Isabel with some pique.  "Other men have found it
both satisfying and stimulating."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled scornfully.  "Not the men who have
loved you as I love you," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Other men love me as much as you do," persisted
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Then let them love you, and let me go," replied Paul
roughly.  "I may be poor and obscure, and a nobody in
your world, but I'm a man all the same, and I'll let no
fine lady make a plaything of me."
</p>

<p>
"You are very unkind!"
</p>

<p>
"I am very unhappy."
</p>

<p>
Isabel pouted.  "It is your own fault if you are.  I'm
sure I am nice enough to you to please the most exacting
man."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't thank you for mere niceness.  Can't
you understand?  You are nice to all the men that
admire you; but there are some things a fellow can't
and won't share.  I am asking for bread&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And therefore when diamonds and rubies fall from
my lips you call them stones," concluded Isabel
flippantly.
</p>

<p>
Paul's face grew stern.  "Don't laugh at me," he
said, "it is doing both yourself and me an injustice.  If
you cannot love me, tell me so, and let me go out of the
sight of your face and live my own life as best I can; and
if you can love me, tell me so, and make me the happiest
man this side Paradise.  But for pity's sake don't play
with me."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes filled with tears.  "Please forgive
me," she said.  "It was horrid of me, but I did not
mean it."
</p>

<p>
"I know you didn't," replied Paul, and his voice
shook.  "Oh! my darling, do you think I don't realize
all that I am asking of you?  Do you think I don't know
all that you will have to give up if you marry a poor man
like me?  But I want you, dear, and I cannot do without
you."
</p>

<p>
"You have always been very good to me," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me&mdash;I cannot bear the suspense any longer&mdash;is
there any chance for me?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked Paul full in the face.  "I will tell you
the truth," she said, "I owe you that, at any rate.  The
best side of me does love you, and wants always to be
with you, and knows that I can never be a really good
woman apart from you.  But there is another side
of me which cares for rank and wealth and power, and
fights against your influence all the time."
</p>

<p>
Paul's eyes were very pitiful.  "I understand," he said.
</p>

<p>
"The question is," continued Isabel, "which of my
two selves is the stronger&mdash;the one that loves you or
the one that doesn't.  And you must leave me to fight it
out by myself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Paul, "that is but fair and just.  I
will wait another week patiently; but after that I must
know my fate once and for all."
</p>

<p>
"And you must always remember," added Isabel,
"that the self that is on your side is my best self; and
that if I decide against you, I shall be choosing evil
rather than good."
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Caroline," said Isabel to Lady Farley the
next day, "Paul Seaton has asked me to be his wife."
</p>

<p>
"I knew he would," replied her aunt, "men with
chins like his never make love without meaning it."
</p>

<p>
"I am to give him his answer in a week; and I want
you to advise me."
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, I dare not give advice on so
important a matter.  You are twenty-seven, and therefore
old enough to know your own mind, and to please yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I mean to please myself, Aunt Caroline; but I
want you to help me to find out what will please me."
</p>

<p>
"I will do all I can in that line with pleasure; but
the decision must rest with you alone.  Tell me your
<i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>."
</p>

<p>
Isabel thought for a moment.  "The <i>pros</i> are that
he is a good man, and a gentleman, and I love him, and
he has the nicest eyes in the whole world."
</p>

<p>
Her aunt smiled.  "And the <i>cons</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>cons</i> are that he has neither money nor position,
and would be considered a poor match in the world
in which I live."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you would be happy with him?"
asked Lady Farley.
</p>

<p>
"Radiantly so.  He is so clever that I should let
him make up my mind upon every subject.  I think it
must be lovely to have a husband to make up one's
mind for one!"
</p>

<p>
"Some women prefer making up the husband's mind
for him.  It is merely a matter of taste, my dear Isabel.
The only thing to be avoided is two separate minds in a
house, each making itself up."
</p>

<p>
"I know," laughed Isabel, "a sort of William-and-Mary
business."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
"What should you do if you were in my place, Aunt
Caroline?"
</p>

<p>
"Personally, it would not amuse me to marry Mr. Seaton;
on the contrary, it would bore me considerably,
he is so didactic and so overpoweringly in earnest; but
that is no reason why it should not amuse you."
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't amuse me to marry Uncle Benjamin,
you see; and yet it amuses you."
</p>

<p>
"Not always, my dear; I have known it have quite
an opposite effect.  But then your uncle is a
G.C.B. and a rich man, and those things amuse me a good
deal."
</p>

<p>
"But love ought to count for something," said Isabel
timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it ought; I am allowing for that; but it
counts a good deal more with some women than it does
with others, and a woman should take this into
consideration.  Some women positively enjoy a little mild
starvation flavoured with romance."
</p>

<p>
"I should, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Then take it, my dear," said Lady Farley, "positive
starvation is always, I believe, indigestible; but the
moderate starvation, which your own comfortable little
income would allow of, might prove quite a treat to
people who like picnics."
</p>

<p>
"By 'moderate starvation' I suppose you mean
doing one's own hair and buttoning one's own boots?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and everything else <i>en suite</i>.  This again is
a matter of taste, and each must please herself; but
what I cannot stand is a woman who deliberately
chooses love in a cottage, and then throws the cottage
in her husband's teeth, and omits the love.  Make
your choice, I say; but when you have made it, stick
to it."
</p>

<p>
"I have no patience with girls who will marry poor
men, and then quarrel with them for being poor,"
agreed Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Neither have I."
</p>

<p>
"If I married Paul, I should never be nasty to him
afterwards because he wasn't rich."
</p>

<p>
"I should hope you would not," said Lady Farley.
"I should be ashamed of having brought you up if you
were.  But that is all the more reason for not being in
a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"I know it is."
</p>

<p>
"I also think, my dear Isabel, that among the <i>cons</i>,
you should reckon up the fact that Lord Wrexham is
very much in love with you, and that you might be a
peeress if you were so minded."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"You should also make a note that Society will invite
Lady Wrexham to dinner, but Mrs. Paul Seaton only
to the reception afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Isabel winced.  "I know that also."
</p>

<p>
"Then, my dear child, there is no more to be said.
This is the evidence: it is for you to consider the
verdict."
</p>

<p>
And Isabel did consider it to the exclusion of every
other subject; and grew pale and wan with the conflict
betwixt her contending inclinations.  But&mdash;true to her
order&mdash;she fulfilled all her social engagements, and talked
and laughed as courageously as ever.
</p>

<p>
The Marchioness of Wallingford's ball was one of the
events of the season&mdash;and it fell on the eve of the day
when Isabel was to give Paul his final answer.  Yet the
girl was as undecided as ever when she donned her
war-paint.
</p>

<p>
During the evening she sat out a dance with Lord
Bobby.  He and Isabel had become firm and fast friends
since he had confided to her his attachment to her
cousin Violet, and she had sympathized with him.
</p>

<p>
"You don't look very flourishing," said Lord Bobby
kindly, as they sat together under the shelter of a huge
palm.  "Has any one been bullying you?"
</p>

<p>
"Life in general has been bullying me," replied Isabel
sadly.
</p>

<p>
"How vile of it!  I never thought so badly of life
before.  It certainly won't be worth living if it begins to
be rude to you; I shall have to give it the cut direct by
committing suicide, if it insults you again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! Bobby, do help me," cried Isabel, with a sudden
impulse laying a beseeching little hand on his arm.
"You are so young and foolish, and everybody else is so
old and wise.  I'm old and wise too, and I'm sick of it."
</p>

<p>
"Poor little girl, what is wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Paul Seaton wants me to marry him, and I want it
too&mdash;but I'm not sure if I've the courage to make such a
bad match.  I know I'm a wretch to feel like that, but
that is how I feel."
</p>

<p>
Bobby's pleasant face grew grave.  "I know," he said.
</p>

<p>
"The good part of me loves him, but the worldly part
of me loves money and position and pleasure, and I
don't know which is in the majority."
</p>

<p>
"If you were only a Government instead of a woman,
you'd find out by means of a dissolution," remarked his
lordship: "then try the same method."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" asked Isabel, looking puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"In the event of your dissolution what should you do?"
</p>

<p>
"If I were dying do you mean?  Oh! then, of course,
I should care only for Paul; and money and all that
would matter nothing to me."
</p>

<p>
"Then why not apply the dissolution test to a woman
as well as to a Government?" suggested Lord Robert.
</p>

<p>
"There is a good deal in what you say.  I feel sure
that if I sent Paul away my heart would cry out for him
sooner or later."
</p>

<p>
"Then why not let it cry now, when there is a chance
of an <i>R.S.V.P.</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I am afraid to give up all the rank and
pleasure and luxury that have made life so pleasant to me.
It is selfish of me, I know, but I can't help it."
</p>

<p>
"You seem in a regular fix!" said Lord Bobby with
much sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"Every one I consult is so old and wise, and knows so
well the value of outside things.  Does everybody grow
worldly as they grow older, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Everybody except mothers," answered Bobby simply.
"They never get old or wise or anything horrid."
</p>

<p>
"But I haven't got a mother," said Isabel, with a
little catch in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little girl!" said Bobby, and there were tears
in his honest blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You see," continued Isabel, "if I marry Paul, the
frivolous side of me may come to the front when it is too
late, and I may spoil his life by becoming a dissatisfied
and grumbling wife."
</p>

<p>
Bobby nodded.
</p>

<p>
"While, on the other hand, if I let him go, I shall
become hard and shallow and worldly, and the best part
of my nature will die of starvation.  Oh!  Bobby, what
am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
Bobby thought profoundly for several seconds; then
he said: "Seaton is a good fellow, there is no doubt of
that; but the question just now is not what is he in
himself, but how much does he count for in your estimate
of life?"
</p>

<p>
"That is just what I want to find out," sighed Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Look here!" continued Bobby; "when he comes
into a room does it seem to you as if the place was full
of pink light, and the band was playing 'God save the
Queen' outside?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, it feels just like that," assented Isabel
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Then if you've got to that stage, you mustn't let
him go; there is only one course open to you.  When
you feel like that, you can't of course be sure that you'll
be happy with that particular person; but you may be
certain that you'll be utterly miserable without him."
</p>

<p>
"There is my next partner searching for me," said
Isabel, rising from her seat.  "Thank you, Bobby; how
you have helped me!"
</p>

<p>
A few days after Lady Wallingford's ball, Lady Esdaile
called upon her sister-in-law.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Caroline," she began, "is it true that
Isabel has engaged herself to that young Seaton?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly true," replied Lady Farley with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"How funny of her!  He isn't at all well off; but
Isabel has got her own money, so that won't matter as
much as it might if she hadn't anything; though I can't
help feeling it is a poor match for a girl who has been
run after as much as Isabel."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel is old enough to please herself."
</p>

<p>
"Of course she is, Caroline; I'd been married for ages
and ages when I was as old as Isabel.  But please don't
think I'm saying anything against Mr. Seaton, because
I'm not.  He is a dear man, and no one knows how
adorable he was once when Dick was ill.  I was always
confusing the gargle with the medicine, and wanting to
give the dear boy the wrong one by mistake; but
Mr. Seaton never once mistook them for each other.  Wasn't
it awfully clever of him?"
</p>

<p>
"He is generally considered to be a clever man," remarked
Lady Farley drily.
</p>

<p>
"I know he is; and so good and religious too.  Of
course it is awfully nice for a man to be clever and
religious and all that, but it seems a funny reason for
marrying him, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley smiled satirically.  "Funnier than if he
were rich or had a title," she said.
</p>

<p>
"But Isabel always was rather original, Caroline.  I
wonder if she will be happy with Mr. Seaton."
</p>

<p>
"That is the idea, I believe.  Of course one cannot
tell yet how it will work out."
</p>

<p>
"And you will miss her, I dare say," continued Lady
Esdaile, not noticing that her sister-in-law winced at this
remark, "it will quite be like losing a daughter.  I should
mind dreadfully if Violet were to get married&mdash;and yet I
should mind more if she didn't, I think.  It really is
difficult to know always what one does want."
</p>

<p>
"And still more difficult to get it," added Lady Farley.
</p>

<p>
"I never know which one hates the most&mdash;the men
who want to marry your daughter or the men who don't.
They both seem tiresome somehow, don't they, Caroline?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Constance, all men are more or less tiresome."
</p>

<p>
"I know," replied Lady Esdaile feelingly, "and so
silly about their dinners.  Richard says our new cook
is 'a woman of one gravy,' and he wants me to speak
about it to the housekeeper; but if ever I do speak about
things it always ends in unpleasantness, and I'd far
rather make Richard angry than one of the servants;
so I shan't interfere."
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley smiled.
</p>

<p>
"It takes all my courage," continued Lady Esdaile,
"to scold my own maid about things that really matter&mdash;such
as the way she does my hair and puts my clothes on;
and I really have none to spare for dinners, and things
like that.  But I do wonder if Isabel will be happy.  I
should think a small house would feel pokey, even with
a really nice man like Mr. Seaton.  Shouldn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Stuffy to a degree, I should imagine.  Especially if
one knew that one might be reigning as Lady Wrexham
at Vernacre instead."
</p>

<p>
And Lady Farley sighed again; for she had been very
proud of Isabel.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
Eden.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  As a place of residence Eden was closed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Adam and Eve left home;<br>
  And no one can live there, it is supposed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many a year to come.<br>
  But now and again, in the summer days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gardens are open thrown<br>
  That the public may walk down the grassy ways:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nobody walks alone.<br>
</p>

<p>
Paul and Isabel were sitting in Kensington Gardens
under the very tree where he asked her if she
would be his wife.  They now considered this
tree their own peculiar property, and felt
inclined to prosecute as trespassers any impertinent persons
who dared so much as to walk beneath its shadow; and
here was their usual trysting-place in those long and
happy afternoons when the year and their engagement
were alike young.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it dreadful to think how we lived all those
years without even having seen each other?" remarked
Paul.
</p>

<p>
Isabel sighed.  "It was a shocking waste of time!"
</p>

<p>
"And it kept me so ignorant and backward," added
Paul, "I used to think that fine ladies were animated
fashion-plates."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think they are now?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think; I know that they are ideal beings
with the airs of Paradise and the graces of Paris."
</p>

<p>
"I used to think that men were stupid creatures who
only cared about dinners and debentures and things of
that sort," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think them now?"
</p>

<p>
"I know they are intelligent animals with abominable
tempers."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.  "You are very rude!"
</p>

<p>
"I know I am.  That is because I care for you.  I
am always rude to the people I really care for."
</p>

<p>
"That is unwise of you," remarked Paul, "though a
not uncommon form of unwisdom.  I have often noticed
that the people who are ready to die for you, never
think it necessary to pass the salt.  They seem to
imagine that the greater includes the less&mdash;which it
doesn't."
</p>

<p>
"The wise people," added Isabel, "are aware that if
they only pay you compliments and open your umbrella
for you, they will have all the credit of dying for you
with none of the expense.  They are clever enough to
know that, in questions of manners, the less includes
the greater&mdash;or at any rate infers it."
</p>

<p>
"Then why are you rude to me, my dear Isabel?
You don't seem to live up to your principles."
</p>

<p>
"I don't.  A girl once told me that I should make a
bad wife, a good friend, and a simply perfect
acquaintance; and I believe she was right."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "That is hardly a comforting prospect
for me, but I mean to risk it nevertheless."
</p>

<p>
"You see," continued Isabel, who always enjoyed
vivisecting herself, "I am awfully nice to people until I
begin to care for them; then I become horrid.  It is
unfortunate, I admit, but nevertheless it is true."
</p>

<p>
"As I remarked before, I cannot commend your
wisdom," said Paul, "I should pursue a precisely opposite
course myself."
</p>

<p>
"You do," replied Isabel with generosity; "unlike
me, you live up to your principles.  When first I met
you, I thought you rather stiff and difficult to get on
with; talking to you was like walking up-hill or rowing
up-stream; but now you grow more delightful every
day, and more easy to talk to."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked pleased.  "I certainly take more trouble
to be nice to you than to anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"And you succeed beyond your wildest expectations.
But I am quite different; as long as I really didn't care
for you, I was able to be perfectly charming; I know I
was."
</p>

<p>
"You both were and are," said Paul.
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I know as well as ever the
things I ought to say to you to please you, and a year
ago I should have said them; but now my own feelings
get in the way, and I want to say the things that please
me; and so I cease to be charming."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear girl, the things that please you please
me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, they don't; you deceive yourself if you
think they do.  Though less clever than I was before I
fell in love, I am still a clever woman, and I know that
if I said to you all I want to say I should bore you to
death."
</p>

<p>
"Try me, that's all!" was Paul's terse rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
"For instance, if I followed my own impulses, I
should ask you every hour if you loved me as much as
you did the hour before."
</p>

<p>
"That would be a foolish question; you know I do."
</p>

<p>
"Then," continued Isabel, "I should ask you if you
liked me as well as other people and things, all of which
I should mention separately, till the list was as long
and exhaustive as the <i>Benedicite</i>."
</p>

<p>
"That also would be a foolish question; you know I
love you more than everything and everybody else put
together."
</p>

<p>
"You see I was right," cried Isabel triumphantly;
"my normal conversation, if I gave the rein to it, would
bore you."
</p>

<p>
"No, it wouldn't; you couldn't bore me if you tried;
but I own I should consider it somewhat unnecessary."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe a man ever could really understand a
woman," said Isabel rather sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not, any more than a woman could really
understand a man.  But I don't see that it matters, as
long as they love one another."
</p>

<p>
Isabel was silent.
</p>

<p>
"What I don't understand in women is their passion
for trying dangerous experiments," continued Paul.
"Now, I am ready to suffer any amount of pain, if you
could gain any benefit thereby; but I am not ready, I
confess, to suffer any amount of pain, for you just to see
how I look when I am suffering it."
</p>

<p>
Isabel tried not to smile, but failed.  "Do you know
when I am trying experiments on you?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly; I am not such a fool as you think, and I
strongly object to the process.  Besides it does as little
credit to your eye as to your heart, because I really don't
look at all nice when I am cross or unhappy.  Now do I?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear Paul, I am bound to own that affliction
is most unbecoming to you."
</p>

<p>
"Then why subject me to it?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel made another futile attempt not to smile.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said her lover, "if you will only say
straight out to me, 'I am going to talk to Mr. Jones or
Mr. Smith just to make you jealous,' I shall know what
you are driving at; and I will be a very Othello as long as
it pleases you.  In fact you needn't bring Jones or Smith
into the concern at all; just say, 'Paul, I want you to be
jealous for half an hour,' and I will entertain the
green-eyed monster to any extent."
</p>

<p>
"How absurd you are!"
</p>

<p>
"But," continued Paul, "when you suddenly&mdash;without
any apparent reason&mdash;develop an abnormal craving for
the society of Jones or Smith, coupled with an equally
inexplicable aversion to the sight of me, I cannot for the
life of me make out what I have done to offend you; and
my days are made wretched and my nights hideous by
dreams of suicide and agonies of remorse."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "If you are clever enough to see
through my little game, why does it make you so
miserable?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"That is where I am such an ass!  Although, by this
time, I have learnt the reason of your intermittent
attachments to Jones or Smith, nothing but the customs of
good society&mdash;grafted on to an early religious training&mdash;keeps
me from punching of heads and shedding of blood
every time I see you smile on the brutes."
</p>

<p>
"You dear man, you really are very nice!"
</p>

<p>
"So are you, when you don't think that a course of
jealousy is necessary to my moral training," added Paul.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't good for you to have everything your own
way," said Isabel reprovingly.
</p>

<p>
"If you want to see how I look when I am being hurt,
tell me so, and I will go and have a tooth out," said Paul
pleasantly, "I should much prefer that, to seeing you
talk to the sort of idiots you flirt with sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"You are a very obliging young man!"
</p>

<p>
"I am.  True, this plan can only be carried out
thirty-two times, for obvious reasons; but I daresay we
shall think of something else for the thirty-third, if only
you will be patient."
</p>

<p>
"Does it really hurt much when I am nasty to you?"
inquired Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I should think so.  Can't you see that it does?"
</p>

<p>
"You look rather horrid, Paul, I must say, on those
occasions."
</p>

<p>
"And I feel horrid too.  Yet I am a reasonable man,
and I can see that you had a right to try this dodge two
or three times, just to prove to yourself that I really
cared; but what beats me is why you keep on doing it,
when you are as certain that I love you as you are that I
am sitting here.  It is like vaccinating a baby every week,
just to torture the creature."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Paul, I don't do it every week; only once in
three weeks at most."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "Couldn't you make the experiments
'like angels' visits, few and far between'?  Say once in
six weeks now?"
</p>

<p>
"You forgive me each time, however often I do it;
I've noticed that."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I should forgive you till seventy times seven,
but that doesn't make it any the pleasanter for me."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old boy!" whispered Isabel tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," said Paul, "I want you to come with
me to see my people.  You have not seen them yet, and
I want to show them what a prize I have been lucky
enough to win.  Will you come to Chayford with me
next week?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if you want me to.  I will do anything you
want, Paul, always."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will go next Tuesday."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if your people will like me," mused Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Of course they will.  How could they&mdash;being
sane&mdash;do otherwise?"
</p>

<p>
"Suppose they don't like me," persisted Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall quarrel with them; but they will, I am
sure of it."
</p>

<p>
"How sure you always are of everything, Paul!"
</p>

<p>
"Am I?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; you are so strong, you always do what you
mean to do, and other people always do what you
wish."
</p>

<p>
Paul shook his head.  "I have meant to do two things
in my life, and I have only done one of them.  Fifty per
cent. is not such an enormous success after all."
</p>

<p>
"What were the two things?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I meant to take a First at Oxford, and I meant to
make you love me."
</p>

<p>
"But it wasn't your own fault that you couldn't take a
First; at least it would have been your fault if you had
done so, instead of helping your people.  It was splendid
of you to give up your ambition for them!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, dear," said Paul.  "Still, the fact
remains that I did not do what I meant to do; which
shows that there is a stronger Power than one's own
will after all.  I used to think that success or failure lay
in the hollow of one's hand; and now I am beginning to
see that the best of us can do nothing but 'rough-hew'.
But when I was young I made up my mind to shape my
own ends for myself."
</p>

<p>
"And now?"
</p>

<p>
"As regards the two things that I wanted most,
Divinity shaped the one and it is left to you to shape the
other; so I am not such a very independent fellow after
all."
</p>

<p>
"I hope I shall shape my part all right," said Isabel
softly.
</p>

<p>
Paul looked grave.  "It will go hard with me if you
don't, Isabel."
</p>

<p>
There was great excitement at Chayford over the
news of Paul's engagement.  Mrs. Martin had always
hated Paul for fear he should wish to marry Alice; but
she hated him still more for not having wished it, and
she hated Isabel most of all for having come between
Alice and the thing which was considered most
undesirable for her.
</p>

<p>
"I trust that this engagement will turn out for Paul's
real welfare," she said to Paul's mother one day; "but
I have my doubts, as Miss Carnaby is evidently a
thoroughly worldly person, and so will probably be very
extravagant."
</p>

<p>
"Paul is so devoted to Miss Carnaby that I feel no
doubt about her making him happy," replied Paul's mother
cheerfully, "and I am sure she must be really nice and
good, or else Paul would not be so fond of her."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin shook her head.  "Beauty and rank are
minor matters, and have, I fear, proved more attractive
to Paul than more solid charms."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Carnaby is not beautiful, however," suggested
Mrs. Seaton, "though Paul says her aunt, Lady Farley,
is."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin pricked up her ears at the title.  "Is
her aunt called Lady Farley, did you say?  Dear me,
how very interesting!  What Farleys are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Benjamin Farley is a G.C.B., I believe, and had
an Indian governorship for a time."
</p>

<p>
"I know the name; I have often seen it in the papers;
but I had no idea that Sir Benjamin was a prospective
relative of dear Paul's.  I hope, Mrs. Seaton, that should
Lady Farley ever visit you, you will do your old friend
the honour of asking me to meet her."
</p>

<p>
"I do not expect Lady Farley ever will visit me,"
said the minister's wife rather stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Still if she did, dear friend, it would be such a
delight to me to meet her.  And such an advantage, too;
for talking with those interesting and distinguished public
characters is an education in itself, I consider."
</p>

<p>
Although Mrs. Seaton fully recognized the necessity
for education on Mrs. Martin's part, she did not feel
herself called upon to supply the need; so she merely
said: "Paul and Miss Carnaby are coming to stay with
us next week."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed; how very delightful!  I hope that you will
bring the dear young lady frequently to see us while she
is with you.  She will doubtless feel much more at home
in a house like The Cedars than in a small cottage such
as this."
</p>

<p>
"Paul's wife will have to make herself at home among
Paul's people," said Mrs. Seaton quietly.
</p>

<p>
"But think of the discomfort," persisted Mrs. Martin
with her usual tact and refinement of feeling, "to a
person accustomed to a large establishment!  Don't you
think it would be better if Miss Carnaby stayed at The
Cedars altogether?  Mr. Martin and I should be very
pleased to entertain her, and she would be a nice friend
for Alice."  And visions of Alice's entry into society, by
the door of Isabel, floated through Mrs. Martin's mind.
</p>

<p>
"It is very kind of you, but I am sure Paul would
prefer Miss Carnaby to stay with us.  You see, if she is
a lady, she will think no worse of us for having a small
house and living quietly; and if she is not, Paul had
better find it out before it is too late."
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Martin still looked doubtful.  "It will be a
great change from what she is accustomed to, and I
cannot help feeling that the dear young lady would be more
at home with us."
</p>

<p>
The minister's wife could hardly restrain a smile as
she recalled a sentence in her son's last letter, which said:
"Whatever you do, keep those awful Martins out of the
way; their blatant vulgarity would make Isabel positively
ill, and I don't want her to be exposed to it".  But she
wisely kept the humour of the situation to herself, and
held her peace.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you will dine late while Miss Carnaby is
with you," persisted Mrs. Martin: "an early dinner is
considered extremely vulgar by well-bred people, I can
assure you."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton looked surprised.  "Certainly not; why
should we?  I cannot see anything vulgar in the time of
one's dinner&mdash;it is merely a matter of household
convenience.  But I think it would be extremely vulgar to
alter our habits so as to make our visitor imagine that we
were in any way different from what we are.  Nothing is
really vulgar save pretence; and that is always vulgar, in
whatever rank of society it is found."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! dear Mrs. Seaton, you are too unworldly.
Believe me, it is the small things that you despise&mdash;such
as late dinners and plenty of servants and proper
evening-dresses&mdash;that make the difference between gentlepeople
and others."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?  I had an idea that the difference
lay in quite another direction."
</p>

<p>
"Then you were mistaken," replied Mrs. Martin.  "I
am extremely sensitive to such things myself, and I
assure you I should not feel that I was a lady if I dined
before seven o'clock, and did not dress for dinner.  It is
in these trifles that good breeding is really shown.
Mr. Martin laughs at me; but I tell him I could not digest
my dinner if I did not wear a low dress and a flower in
my hair&mdash;even if it were only a chrysanthemum."
</p>

<p>
For the first time in her life Mrs. Seaton felt that her
sense of humour ran on the same lines as Mr. Martin's;
but she did not point out this similarity to his wife.  She
merely preserved the chrysanthemum in her memory, to
regale Paul and Joanna with at some future time.
</p>

<p>
But there was no one in Chayford more deeply
interested in Paul's love-affair than Martha.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to be sure, Miss Joanna," she said one day;
"it seems only yesterday that I whipped Master Paul for
flying into a passion and kicking Mrs. Martin's cook,
because she passed the remark that you were the ugliest
little girl she'd ever set eyes on; and now he is old enough
to be taking to himself a wife.  Time does fly, and no
mistake!"
</p>

<p>
Joanna sighed.  She was a good woman, and unselfish,
but it is "a bitter thing to look into happiness
through another man's eyes".  "Isabel Carnaby is a
lucky girl," she remarked; "for I am sure Paul is a man
who will make any woman happy."
</p>

<p>
Martha shook her head.  "Don't be too sure of
anything about a man, miss&mdash;not even if it is our Paul.
They are queer creatures, even the best of them!"
</p>

<p>
"You are always hard on men, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"So I am, miss, they are such wild, feckless folks.
First in a tantrum about one thing, and then about
another, till there is no pleasing them; and they are no
use&mdash;and far less ornament&mdash;as far as I can see."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand how to manage them, I am
afraid," laughed Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Not I, my dear.  The Lord Who made them may
understand them, but I don't; for if I'd had the making
of them, they'd have been made after a different pattern,
I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
"But you must not say all this to Miss Carnaby,"
warned the wise Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, miss; I know well enough what
to say to folks that are courting.  Now there was
my niece, Eunice Tozer; she got engaged to a young
man in her father's shop&mdash;and a sore disappointment it
was to them all, herself included, that she hadn't done
better."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you didn't say so to her, Martha."
</p>

<p>
"Not I, my dear!  She came complaining to me that
it was but a poor settling for her, but I soon cheered her
up.  'Eunice,' says I, 'with such a plain face as yours
it is a wonder you've got a husband at all&mdash;let alone the
sort; and you ought to be thankful, instead of finding
fault.'  That was the way to look at the matter, to my
thinking, and I soon made Eunice see it in the same
light."
</p>

<p>
"Was Eunice happy when she was married?"
Joanna asked.
</p>

<p>
"As happy as any woman could be with a man tied
to her for the rest of her days; but, as you know, I don't
hold with the men, miss.  They are troublesome creatures,
especially all of them."
</p>

<p>
"They are indeed," exclaimed Joanna with amusement.
</p>

<p>
"You see, miss, my mother always said that the
troubles which came direct from the Lord, she could
bear without murmuring; but the troubles which came
from father's stupidity were a different thing, and she
hadn't common patience with them.  Many a time has
she passed the remark that, if a woman has got a husband,
she spends all her life in bearing for him the
consequences of the things she particularly told him not
to do."
</p>

<p>
Joanna nodded.  "That must really be very irritating!
It would try me more than anything."
</p>

<p>
"And me too, miss.  There is nothing like a man for
trying the temper.  Mark my word, it is because there
is no marrying or giving in marriage in heaven that the
temper of an angel <i>is</i> the temper of an angel.  If the
angels had got husbands, there'd be a different tale about
their tempers, I'll be bound!"

CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
His Own People.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Where thou goest I will go,<br>
  Through the sunshine or the snow:<br>
  Where thou dwellest I will dwell,<br>
  In a court or in a cell:<br>
  All thy people mine shall be,<br>
  Since myself is one with thee.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was the day of Isabel's arrival at Chayford, and
Mrs. Seaton's face was pink with excitement and
anxiety that everything should be as Paul wished
for Paul's bride-elect.  The tea-table was spread with
every simple dainty that Martha could suggest and carry
out; and was covered with Mrs. Seaton's best table-cloth&mdash;a
specimen of the finest and most silky-looking damask,
with an elegant border composed of arum lilies, and an
effigy of John Wesley in the centre.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot help feeling a little nervous," said
Mrs. Seaton, "I am so anxious that everything should be
as Paul would like."
</p>

<p>
The minister smiled.  "My dear, you are careful and
troubled about many things.  If Isabel Carnaby loves
our Paul, as I believe she does, she will not notice what
viands are spread out before her, nor what servants are
ready to serve her.  She will be so happy to feel herself
in Paul's presence, that minor matters will be of no
moment to her."
</p>

<p>
"But I do want everything to be nice," persisted
Mrs. Seaton plaintively.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry so, mother," chimed in the sensible
Joanna; "we have done our best to prepare a warm
welcome for Isabel; and if she isn't pleased, it is her
fault and not ours."
</p>

<p>
"But it is Paul I am thinking of&mdash;not Isabel," said
Mrs. Seaton, "I should be so sorry to disappoint him in
any way."
</p>

<p>
"My love, you really are overburdened with the cares
of this life," replied her husband, "believe me, it is really
of no importance what we eat and how we are clothed,
provided we have wholesome food and garments beseeming
our estate; and it grieves me to see you wearing
yourself out about things that do not signify."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope Paul will be satisfied," repeated Paul's
mother.
</p>

<p>
"There they are!" exclaimed Joanna, as a cab drove
up to the door, and Paul sprang out, followed by an
extremely well-dressed young lady.
</p>

<p>
The minister and his family went into the hall to
receive their visitor; and Mrs. Seaton trembled all over,
for she felt it was an ordeal.  So did Paul; and his
mother knew that he did, as soon as she saw his face.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, this is Isabel," was all he could say; he
was so dreadfully afraid that the two women he loved
best in the world would not say the right things to one
another.
</p>

<p>
But Isabel was equal to the occasion.  She threw
her arms round Mrs. Seaton's neck and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to be a mother to me as well as to
Paul," she whispered.  "I haven't got a mother of my
own, you know, and I do so want one."
</p>

<p>
And then and there the minister's wife took Isabel
into her motherly heart, and never really let her out
again, in spite of all that happened afterwards.
</p>

<p>
When Isabel had duly greeted Mr. Seaton and
Joanna, she was introduced to Martha.
</p>

<p>
"This is our faithful friend, Martha," said Mrs. Seaton,
"she nursed Paul when he was a little boy."
</p>

<p>
Isabel held out her hand with a radiant smile.  "I
must thank you for taking so much care of him for me,"
she said, "if you hadn't sown, I should not have reaped,
so I owe much of my happiness to you."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it, miss," replied Martha, looking
proud and joyful, "it was always a pleasure to do things
for Master Paul, in spite of his temper, which I am
bound to say was one of the hottest I ever came across,
while he was as yet a child of nature and not of grace.
I bore the marks of his dear little teeth in my arm for
many a day, miss, for once contradicting him when he
said that Abraham was the father of Joseph, bless his
heart!"
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed, and so did Paul.
</p>

<p>
"But don't let me discourage you, miss, if you've
made up your mind to get married," added Martha,
fearing that she had said too much, "if you must have
a husband, perhaps Master Paul is the best sort you'll
get; though bad's the best, to my thinking, with regard
to husbands."
</p>

<p>
Tea that evening was a very cheerful meal at Chayford
Cottage.  Isabel was so charmed by the refinement
and culture of Paul's home, that she was at her best.
She found herself in an atmosphere of intellectual
activity such as she was accustomed to, but combined
with a simplicity of life and a familiarity with higher
things such as she had never yet known; and the
combination was very attractive to her.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have much to ask about your life in India,
my dear," said Mr. Seaton to Isabel, as they all sat
round the tea-table, "I have always longed to go there,
and see for myself the remains of one of the world's oldest
and most picturesque civilizations, but I shall never
accomplish it now; so I must beg you to give me
information second-hand."
</p>

<p>
"Martha is immensely impressed by your having lived
in India," exclaimed Joanna; "but she has deliciously
vague ideas about the place.  I think she pictures it to
herself as a 'coral strand' covered with undressed
niggers, like the picture on the cover of the <i>Missionary
Notices</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure that my ideas of India are not a
good deal like that," Paul said; "only I add a few
elephants and pagodas."
</p>

<p>
"She asked me the other day," continued Joanna,
still addressing Isabel, "if I thought you had ever
worshipped idols while you were in India."
</p>

<p>
Isabel sighed.  "I am afraid I sometimes did; but
they were not the native ones."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, my dear," said Mrs. Seaton kindly;
"we have all of us worshipped idols at some time or
another&mdash;except, of course, the minister."
</p>

<p>
Her husband shook his head.  "I am afraid, my love,
that I have worshipped idols too; only I bound them in
vellum and called them by theological names."
</p>

<p>
"I expect we have all got a little museum of cast-off
idols somewhere in our hearts," remarked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Which we now and then dust and put in order,"
added Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Although they are no longer used as idols, they are
still interesting as curiosities," said Paul.  "I've got
three fine ones in mine, called rowing and success and
power; and I dare not allow myself to take them out
and dust them too often, for fear I should fall
a-worshipping of them once more."
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Paul!" said his mother tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"I used to have two lovely ones called the world and
fashion," said Isabel; "but Paul came by and knocked
them over in passing, and I have never been able to set
them up again."
</p>

<p>
"I have got a very bothering one named duty," said
Joanna, "and it gives me a lot of trouble, because I am
not quite sure whether it is an idol or not.  Sometimes
I think it is, and then I put it by in the museum; but
at other times it seems to be a legitimate object of
adoration, and then I have to restore it to its shrine.  I
never can decide where to keep the thing for two days
together."
</p>

<p>
"That would worry me," remarked Isabel; "there is
nothing so wearing as indecision."
</p>

<p>
"But you are very undecided, Isabel," argued Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I know I am, and that is why I reprove this characteristic
in other people.  I feel sure I shall become an
old woman before my time, through suffering agonies
of indecision as to whether I shall take my waterproof
to church or not, and how often I shall write to you in a
week."
</p>

<p>
"What idols are in your museum, mother?" inquired
Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! my dear, when a woman is married there is
no room in her heart for anything but God and her
husband and her children; and then she has to be very
careful lest her husband and her children should take up
more than their share of room."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton smiled.  "I do not think you need be
afraid, Ruth; for I believe that the more room we give in
our hearts to our fellow-creatures, the more room there
is left for God."
</p>

<p>
"Paul will have to show you all about Chayford
to-morrow," said Mrs. Seaton, turning to Isabel, "it is a
pretty old town, and the surrounding country is lovely.
Are you a good walker, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I am as fond of walking as I am of talking,
Mrs. Seaton, which is saying a great deal; in fact, I may
confess I am as walkative as I am talkative; walkative
is rather a good word, I think.  I've just invented it."
</p>

<p>
"It is capital," agreed Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Paul has told me about the people here," added
Isabel, "I already know them all by their names.  I am
sure I could pass an examination in Chayford, and take
honours."
</p>

<p>
"It will be fun to show you all the neighbours,"
exclaimed Joanna, "and to see if they are like what you
expect!"
</p>

<p>
"How is Mrs. Martin?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Better than ever!" was Joanna's reply; "she is torn
asunder between her social respect for, and her spiritual
disapproval of, you.  But she reconciles you to herself
by measuring your position in this world and your
prospects in the next by different measures&mdash;like troy
weight and avoirdupois&mdash;so that the two do not clash."
</p>

<p>
"How very nice of her!" exclaimed Isabel with delight.
</p>

<p>
"She offended Martha dreadfully the last time she
called here," continued Joanna, "by saying that our cat's
tail is too short for a real Persian.  Martha related it
to me afterwards with great indignation, and added: 'As
if the Lord didn't know how to make a cat without
Mrs. Martin's interference!'"
</p>

<p>
Everybody laughed; then Isabel said: "Martha is a
dear!  Even in this present world, 'I shall desire more
love and knowledge of her'."
</p>

<p>
"She repays research," remarked Paul, "though I
confess I think she would be more agreeable if her
conscience were not so bent on setting forth unflattering
truths.  I do not ask for lies; but even truth requires
clothing."
</p>

<p>
"Besides it is not always necessary to say the whole
truth about everything," said Mrs. Seaton, "it is wrong
to utter falsehood, but it is not wrong to keep silence."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that if a person had good eyes and an
ugly mouth, you would tell her how pretty her eyes
were, and leave her mouth to speak for itself?" suggested
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton looked amused.
</p>

<p>
"That would be mother's plan," said Joanna; "she
never says anything that could hurt anybody's feelings.
And I believe that, as a matter of fact, she would only
look at the eyes, and never notice that the mouth was
ugly.  She has a splendid habit of only seeing the good
in people and things."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true," agreed the minister.
</p>

<p>
Joanna continued: "I am sorry to say that unpleasant
truths are a terrible temptation to me.  I really
don't mean to be disagreeable, but sometimes they fly out
of my mouth before I have time to stop them.  Miss Dallicot
asked me yesterday if I liked her new bonnet, and
I'd said 'No' before I had time to weigh my words.  I
was extremely sorry afterwards, she looked so hurt."
</p>

<p>
"My child," said Mr. Seaton, "you should consider
other people's feelings, and strive never to give pain
where it can be avoided."
</p>

<p>
"So I do, father; but now and then the truth is too
strong for me.  And I am sure that a glimpse of the
bonnet itself will prove to you that I was not without
provocation."
</p>

<p>
"What was it like?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"It was a ghastly combination of black and white
feathers and red flowers," replied Joanna; "and resembled
a young person's funeral passing through a field of
poppies; it really was a weird sight!"
</p>

<p>
"Thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake
not," said Mr. Seaton reprovingly, "and Miss Dallicot
is a dear and valued friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
"I am not forsaking her, father; I am only describing
her head-gear."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton smiled as he shook his head.  "A man that
hath friends must show himself friendly; and ridicule and
friendliness hardly seem to me compatible, my child."
</p>

<p>
"Wait till you see the bonnet," persisted Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I, for one, am looking forward to the vision,"
exclaimed Paul.  "When she comes into chapel on Sunday,
I shall begin to sing 'The morning flowers display their
sweets'."
</p>

<p>
"Did I tell you that she tumbled down coming into
chapel last Sunday?" said Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;did she?  I wish I'd been there to see," cried
the unregenerate Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she caught her foot on the mat of the door,
staggered up the aisle with increasing speed at every
step, and finally fell&mdash;an inert mass&mdash;at the pulpit steps,
while her parasol and pocket-handkerchief and hymn-book
flew all over the chapel like leaves in autumn."
</p>

<p>
Paul and Isabel laughed heartily; then the latter said:
"My aunt had a similar misadventure the other day.
She sneaked into a shop in Regent Street to inquire the
price of a carpet she had no intention of buying&mdash;a mean
trick, as I told her, and her sin found her out."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what happened?" asked Paul.
</p>

<p>
"She, likewise, tripped on entering, and ran a wild
and reckless race the whole length of the shop.  Brave
young men sprang over the counter to stop her mad career,
and even the cashier rushed out of his little square
pew to check her rapid flight; but all in vain.  She
outstripped them all, and lay at last&mdash;convulsed with
laughter&mdash;at the foot of a mirror at the very far end of
the shop."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton laughed till the tears ran down her face.
"It really seems too bad to laugh at such things, but I
never can help it; I hope Lady Farley was not hurt."
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least.  But you can picture her shame
and humiliation when she had to confess to the crowd of
young men collected to pick up her remains, that she
had only looked in to inquire the price of a carpet!"
</p>

<p>
"It was rather dreadful for her!" agreed Mrs. Seaton,
still simmering with amusement.
</p>

<p>
"I wish Mrs. Martin did not sit just before me in
chapel!" sighed Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Because there is one white tacking-thread left to
sully the glory of her otherwise immaculate Sunday
mantle; and that tacking-thread comes between me and
my devotions.  I am torn between the desire to stretch
forth my hand and pluck it out, and my knowledge that
Mrs. Martin's tacking-threads are no concern of mine."
</p>

<p>
"You should try not to look at it, my dear," said
Mrs. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
"So I do, mother; but the thing rises up and hits me
in the face, so to speak; it is like Gehazi in its unnatural
whiteness."
</p>

<p>
"I should let it stand," said Paul, "as an everlasting
testimony to the truth that even Mrs. Martin is human,
and not beyond the help of tacking-threads.  To my
mind there is something infinitely pathetic and poetical
in the idea.  I feel I could write a poem on it, if not a
tract."
</p>

<p>
"I know I shall tell her about it some day," remarked
Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully interested in your passion for speaking
the truth," said Isabel; "it is just the other way with
me; I always want to say what I feel people want me to
say, rather than what I really think."
</p>

<p>
"How funny!  But that is because it is your nature
to make yourself pleasant.  It is fearfully difficult for me
not to make myself disagreeable&mdash;while to make myself
agreeable is impossible," replied Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Joanna," said her mother.
</p>

<p>
Joanna went on: "I know that people often blame
me for saying disagreeable things; but if they only
knew how many disagreeable things I keep myself from
saying, and how deeply I regret those I do say, they
would commend rather than condemn me."
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Seaton questioned Isabel about her life
abroad, and the conversation never flagged till it was
time for Joanna to go to class, and for Paul and Isabel
to start for a walk in the lanes round Chayford Cottage.
</p>

<p>
Isabel's week at Chayford was a great success.  The
Seatons were charmed with her, and she with them;
and as she and Paul had nothing in the world to do but
to make love to each other, there was no occasion for
jealousies or misunderstandings between them such as
came later in the conflicting interests of "a London
June".
</p>

<p>
Isabel revered Paul's father, because he was so
courteous and so saintly, and had read more than any man
she had ever met; she liked Joanna, because Joanna
was good and clever, and possessed a most admirable
sense of humour; and she loved Mrs. Seaton, because
the minister's wife was the first woman she had ever met
who in some degree satisfied the mother-hunger in her
heart.  And Mrs. Seaton understood Isabel better than
any of them did&mdash;not excluding even Paul.  She knew that
there were depths in the girl's soul, whereof Joanna did
not dream, and which Paul had not yet sounded; and
that&mdash;in spite of her sunny light-heartedness&mdash;Isabel's
nature was very highly strung.  Mrs. Seaton trembled
for them both when she realized that Paul's masterly
touch might prove a little too heavy for so delicate an
instrument, and that some of the strings might break
under the pressure.  But she knew herself powerless
to interfere; for she had learnt that what we call
influence, other people often call impertinence, and
that it is a power which is more prone to do harm than
good.  When people are seized with the desire to set
about improving their neighbours, it is a phase of thought
which might be described as the "negative" of the
missionary spirit; that it to say, it is a form of spiritual
instruction which has the effect of turning Christians into
savages&mdash;for the time being, at any rate.
</p>

<p>
The only person at Chayford that Isabel did not get
on with was Mrs. Martin.  These two fell foul of each
other from the first.  Mrs. Martin began by being
obsequious, and Isabel snubbed her; and the man or woman
who can forgive a social slight is as yet an undiscovered
product of civilization.  Human nature can only stand a
certain strain; and social rudeness stretches this
elasticity to its uttermost limit, if not beyond it.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin opened the ball by calling upon Isabel,
decked out in her Sunday best.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad to meet you, my dear Miss Carnaby,"
she began, addressing herself pointedly to Isabel, and
coolly excluding Mrs. Seaton and Joanna from the
conversation, "I feel sure we shall be friends, for your dear
aunt's sake.  I believe she is one of the Farleys of
Ferngrove, and they were friends of my mother's years ago."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I must confess I never heard of the
Farleys of Ferngrove," said Isabel rather stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Did you not? dear me, how strange!  They were an
old county family in Lancashire when my dear mother
was a girl&mdash;really quite a good old family, I can assure
you&mdash;and she had the pleasure of meeting them once or
twice in those happy old days.  I really think your
distinguished uncle must belong to the same family.  They
were most accomplished and extremely rich."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," said Isabel.  "Uncle Benjamin's
money came to him from his mother's brother, who was
in the iron trade; his father was a clergyman, and was
extremely poor."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin looked shocked; to her mind there was
something indelicate in the mere mention of poverty.
Her father had been extremely poor at the commencement
of his commercial career, but she would have
died rather than mention so disgraceful a fact.  She
wondered that Miss Carnaby had not more refinement
of feeling.  Nevertheless she made another attempt to
establish a friendly footing between herself and this
coarse-minded young woman.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you ever met my dear friends, the
Sedleys?" she said.
</p>

<p>
Isabel did not think so.
</p>

<p>
"They are charming people, dear Miss Carnaby, and
have such aristocratic connections; only last year they
were staying in the same hotel as the Hereditary Grand
Duchess of Edelweiss, somewhere in Switzerland; I
forget the name of the place, but I know it was most
fashionable.  The Sedleys never go to any but really
fashionable resorts."
</p>

<p>
"How very interesting," murmured Isabel politely.
</p>

<p>
"You would delight in Mrs. Sedley, she is so
extremely refined.  She once told me that unless she
always wore silk next her skin, she would die of irritation.
Is it not strange how good-breeding shows itself in these
small trifles?"
</p>

<p>
"Very strange," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"You would hardly believe it, Miss Carnaby, but do
you know I am physically unable to wear cheap boots or
gloves myself?  If I attempted to do so, I should become
lame and helpless at once.  I said to my dear husband
only yesterday, it is not that I wish to be extravagant,
for I hold extravagance a sin; but my skin is so delicate
that the wear of cheap things is simply torture to me."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for you," replied Isabel, "for the
pleasure of the summer sales must be lost upon you.
You cannot imagine how delightful they are!  Lady
Farley and I always attend them; and last season we
took Lady Eleanor Gregory with us, and she revelled in
the bargains even more than we did."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" was all that Mrs. Martin could ejaculate.
</p>

<p>
"I remember," continued Isabel, "that she bought a
sealskin cape, because they were so reduced; and she
nearly died of heat in trying it on, for it was the hottest
day of a very hot July.  We were too warm in muslin
blouses, and we sat laughing at poor Lady Eleanor as
she tried on cape after cape, each one heavier than the
last."
</p>

<p>
"Poor young lady!" remarked Mrs. Martin sympathetically,
"I trust that thus overheating herself did
not result in a chill.  I remember a friend of mine,
Mrs. Albert Simpkinson, died from the effects of a chill,
brought on by overclothing herself on a warm day; and
her premature decease was peculiarly unfortunate, for
she died just as she was beginning to get into good
society."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes twinkled wickedly, but she kept her lips
in order, and did not allow them to relax into a smile.
"How sad!" she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"It was indeed!" sighed Mrs. Martin, "only a fortnight
before Mrs. Simpkinson's death, the Honourable
Mrs. Avalon, daughter-in-law to the Earl of Glastonbury,
called upon her; and she barely had time to return the
call&mdash;much less to follow up the intimacy&mdash;before she
died."
</p>

<p>
But though Isabel did not get on with Mrs. Martin
she looked at everybody else in Chayford through
rose-coloured glasses.  To Martha she was specially gracious,
and was described by that excellent woman as "a sweet
young creature".
</p>

<p>
"Master Paul is a lucky man, and no mistake!" said
Martha one day, "luck being only another name for a
good strong will of your own, coupled with the help of
Providence, as my brother James said when he induced
Mr. Hickory to leave the Grampton circuit."
</p>

<p>
"Who was Mr. Hickory?" inquired Isabel, who
always appreciated Martha when the latter became
retrospective.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hickory was a young minister with new-fangled
notions, who travelled in Grampton for one year, and
then my brother James induced him to leave."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't your brother like his preaching?" asked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, miss, not at all; but it wasn't only his
preaching that James objected to, though that was far
from satisfactory, being more full of modern science
(falsely so called) than of saving truth.  James never
liked Mr. Hickory's views on the devil&mdash;he thought them
broad and dangerous&mdash;but it was not the devil that they
quarrelled over after all; it was the heating apparatus in
Grampton Chapel.  James said he'd have overlooked the
devil if Mr. Hickory had given way about the heating
apparatus, as we must all give and take in this world;
but Mr. Hickory's attitude in that matter was more than
he could or would stand."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked deeply interested, and so did Joanna.
"What was the end of it?" asked the former.
</p>

<p>
"Well, miss, you see, James said that the old heating
apparatus had been good enough for the congregation
for twenty years and more, and if it was good enough for
them it was good enough for Mr. Hickory, and it shouldn't
be altered as long as he was chapel-steward.  But the
minister was set on having some new-fangled arrangement
of his own.  And the minister got his own way,
James was overruled, and the new apparatus was set up
in Grampton Chapel."
</p>

<p>
"Was it a success?"
</p>

<p>
"A success, Miss Carnaby!  Who ever heard of an
improvement of any kind being a success?  I never did.
Give me the old-fashioned things, say I, and don't meddle
with them; for I never yet met with an improvement
that wasn't for the worse."
</p>

<p>
"You are a consistent Conservative, Martha, and I
admire you," laughed Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, miss; I don't go in for politics and all
that rubbish, but I keep my eyes open and see things for
myself, and judge accordingly."
</p>

<p>
"And a very wise plan!" agreed Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"That is as may be, miss."
</p>

<p>
"But how about the new heating apparatus and your
brother James?" suggested Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Well, miss, James never could say if it was a judgment
from heaven or whether it was because the chapel-keeper
put too much coal on; but anyhow the whole
thing caught fire, and burnt part of the wall before it
could be put out."
</p>

<p>
"Was much of the wall burnt?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"A nice piece, miss."
</p>

<p>
Joanna smiled.  "Was that why the minister left?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, miss, after that, Mr. Hickory saw that he had
made a mistake; and my brother James advised him to
leave Grampton and begin again elsewhere.  Before he
went, James told him he would do well if he set about
helping folks to get new hearts, and left their old heating
apparatuses alone.  Which was good advice, to my thinking,
though it was my own brother as gave it."
</p>

<p>
The happy days at Chayford passed all too quickly.
When Sunday came, Isabel went with Paul to hear his
father preach; and she never forgot her first service in
Chayford Chapel.  She possessed the artistic temperament
to an unusual extent, and therefore beauty in worship
strongly appealed to her, whether it were shown in
ornate ritual or in extreme simplicity.  To such natures
as hers a stately cathedral filled with the voice of a great
multitude, and a bleak hillside where a handful of
persecuted Covenanters are assembled, seem alike the house
of God and the gate of heaven; for the artist-soul is slow
to discern the theological differences of the two or three
gathered together, but is quick to perceive and to
prostrate itself before the perfect beauty of the One in the
midst of them.
</p>

<p>
Isabel Carnaby was an extremely emotional woman,
and consequently experienced the quick vision of the truth,
and the rapid clouding over of the same, which are the
portion of all emotional temperaments.
</p>

<p>
As she sat beside Paul in Chayford Chapel that
Sunday morning she was at her best.  Her love for him
stimulated the religious, and stifled the worldly, side of
her character.  Herein lay the fundamental difference
between herself and Joanna: Joanna was a good woman
because she loved God; Isabel was a good woman because
she loved a good man&mdash;a lower type, perhaps, from
a spiritual point of view, but one none the less to be
considered, since the vessels in a great house are not all
of equal honour, and the stars in the firmament are not
all of the same glory.
</p>

<p>
The minister preached a beautiful sermon on Love
as the fulfilling of the Law; and as Isabel listened, her
soul was uplifted and her understanding quickened.  She
made up her mind that, however she might fail in other
things, the forgiveness accorded to them that love much
should always be her right; and that she would never
allow clouds of doubt and misunderstanding to arise
between her and those whom it was her duty to love and
to cherish.  Them, she vowed, she would love to the
end&mdash;and all others for their sakes.  It seemed to Isabel
an easy thing, sitting in the quaint little chapel and
listening to the minister's silvery voice, to love both the
brother whom she had seen and the God Whom she had
not seen; but many things look easy from the Mount of
Transfiguration, which grow difficult&mdash;if not
impossible&mdash;amid the rabble of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
The hymn after the sermon was, "There is a land of
pure delight," and it thrilled Isabel through and through.
As she and Paul sang it together, she felt that for them
the "everlasting spring" had already begun and the
"never-withering flowers" were theirs, because they
loved each other.
</p>

<p>
So Paul and Isabel rested for a while upon the Delectable
Mountains, and imagined that they were even now
in Paradise.  But they forgot how it is written that "a
little below these mountains on the left hand, lieth the
country of Conceit, from which country there comes
into the way in which the pilgrims walked a little crooked
lane".
</p>

<p>
John Bunyan knew what he was talking about when
he described the country of Conceit as lying close under
the shadow of the Delectable Mountains.

CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
A Feast of Good Things.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  They talked of things created long,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And things but lately come to pass,<br>
  Down from the Swan of Avon's song<br>

<p>
With the exception of the Seatons, there was
no one at Chayford that Isabel Carnaby
liked so well as the Fords; for she felt&mdash;as
most people did who were brought under
the spell of its influence&mdash;the fascination of Chayford
House.  It was a most attractive home, with its huge
stone gateway in front, forming the full-stop to Chayford
High Street; and its beautiful park at the back, studded
with fine old elms and sloping down to the river.  And
not the least picturesque feature in one of the prettiest
parks in Mershire was Chayford Cottage, nestling among
the trees, and covered with purple clematis and scarlet
virginia-creeper in their season.  Chayford House was
equally interesting within and without; it was one of the
delightful houses where the drawing-room is merely an
<i>Ã©dition de luxe</i> of the library; and, when all is said and
done, there is no drawing-room paper as effective as
vellum and half-calf.
</p>

<p>
Michael Ford had been, as the Irishman said, a rich
man for several generations; and his home bore the
hallmark of a century's refinement and luxury.  He had all the
geniality of a man who has never had a misunderstanding&mdash;much
less a fight&mdash;with circumstances; and there was
not a grain of bitterness in his composition.  He was a
Wesleyan, as his fathers had been before him; but he
gave as generously to the Anglicans and the Independents
in Chayford as he gave to his own Church&mdash;and his gifts
to all were munificent.  He was sensible rather than
scholarly, and wise rather than learned.  In politics he
was a Whig of the old school; and the only disappointment
of his otherwise successful life was that he had
been compelled by business engagements to abandon his
cherished desire for a parliamentary career.  But he
intended this for his son in his place; and the object of his
ambition was to see Edgar member for Chayford on the
Liberal side.
</p>

<p>
Edgar's character, inherited from some far-off Puritan
ancestor, was incomprehensible to his father; but
Mr. Ford shared the common and comfortable parental
delusion that the perfect acquiescence of children in their
parents' views is merely a question of time.
</p>

<p>
It was strange that while Mark Seaton's son made
an idol of success, Michael Ford's son made a Moloch of
conscience; yet Mark Seaton's affections were set
entirely on things above, and Michael Ford possessed
common-sense to a degree which almost raised it to the
level of genius.  But these things happen.
</p>

<p>
During Isabel's week at Chayford she saw a great
deal of Edgar.  He understood her better than Paul did,
and therefore he did not fall in love with her.  Mutual
comprehension makes for friendship, and militates against
love; for love&mdash;like modern society papers&mdash;must have
a "puzzle column" for the mystification of those that
take it in.  Isabel's emotional temperament was nearer
akin to Edgar's mysticism than to Paul's dogged
determination; so she and Edgar became good friends, and
there was no element of danger in their friendship.
</p>

<p>
It was characteristic of Edgar that in the days when
he believed that Paul loved Alice, his conscience forbade
him to speak to the girl, because he wanted to do so;
but in the days when Paul loved Isabel, Edgar talked to
her freely, simply because such conversation gave him
no particular pleasure.  To make himself miserable was
an irresistible temptation to Edgar Ford.
</p>

<p>
On the eve of Isabel's return to town, there was a
small dinner-party at Chayford House.  In addition to
the four Seatons and their guest, the company included
the Reverend Henry Stoneley, Rector of Chayford, and
his popular wife; Mr. Madderley (an artist who was
painting Mrs. Ford's portrait), and Alice Martin.
</p>

<p>
After the migration into the dining-room, Mr. Ford
began:
</p>

<p>
"Does any one know the result of the Sidbury election?"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard nothing authentic," replied the rector;
"but I have good reasons for believing that the
Conservative has been returned."
</p>

<p>
"That is what I expected," exclaimed his host; "the
Liberals there are divided into two camps with two
separate leaders, namely the regular Liberal and a
Labour candidate; and if our people will persist in thus
splitting up their forces, your people are always bound to
get in."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true," said Mrs. Ford, "Conservatives
have learnt the lesson of obedience to their leaders."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever noticed," remarked Isabel Carnaby,
"that, when it comes to the point, a Conservative will
vote for the worst Conservative rather than for the best
Liberal; while a Liberal will rather not vote at all than
support a candidate who does not share his every prejudice?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Stoneley smiled.  "Our people certainly know
how to pull together."
</p>

<p>
"And our people don't," added Mr. Ford, "that is
the weakness of the Liberal party; each individual is too
fond of thinking out things for himself, and judging from
his own limited observation, rather than from the
experience of wiser men."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, father," said Edgar, "but I
should call that the strength of the Liberal party.
Surely conscientious and reasonable support is better
than blind and unreasoning obedience."
</p>

<p>
"More gratifying to the individual perhaps," replied
his father, "but disastrous to the party."
</p>

<p>
"Moreover," added the rector, "it does not do for
every man to be a law unto himself.  Liberty carried too
far degenerates into anarchy."
</p>

<p>
"If every man does what is right in his own eyes,
what becomes of law and order?" suggested Mr. Seaton.
"Strength is shown by self-suppression rather than by
self-glorification."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," agreed the rector.  "The whole crux of
civilization seems to me to lie in the fact that the savage
does what is best for himself, and the civilized man what
is best for the community at large."
</p>

<p>
"And government is but a great mutual insurance
society against human selfishness," added Mr. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
"I quite agree with that," said Mrs. Ford, "the suppression
of self is the end and aim of civilization as well
as of Christianity."
</p>

<p>
"Just so, my dear madam, just so.  Nevertheless I
should not say that Conservatives do not think out matters
for themselves," objected the rector, "for they do."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! don't say that," cried Isabel, "do not, at one
fell swoop, take away the one virtue of the Conservative
party."
</p>

<p>
The rector smiled.  "Loyal old Tory as I am, I
should not wish to recommend my party to alien eyes by
assuming virtues when it has them not, my dear young
lady."
</p>

<p>
"But," persisted Edgar, "I never can understand
why what is wrong for an individual can be right for
a party or a State."
</p>

<p>
"That is beside the mark," interpolated Mr. Ford.
</p>

<p>
Edgar looked puzzled.  Things were always so clear
to his father, and they were hardly ever clear to him.
He groped after the truth, but he often failed to grasp it.
</p>

<p>
"Obedience is right in all men," said Mr. Seaton,
"whether they be taken as individuals or as communities.
To submit to authority is one of man's highest and most
important duties."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, quite so," agreed the rector; "yet now-a-days
people are in sad danger of forgetting this."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?" said Paul Seaton.  "For my
part I consider that the modern enthusiasm for games
and athletics of all kinds is a powerful antidote to
individualism and faddism and their attendant follies.
Therefore, if I had my way, I would insist on every man's
taking up a game of some kind, and becoming proficient
in it."
</p>

<p>
"And a very good plan," cried the rector heartily;
"a very good plan, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"You see," continued Paul, "as long as England had
to fight for her existence among the nations, there was
no talk about each particular Englishman's special
prejudices and crotchets; this is one of the evils following
in the train of peace and plenty.  But by teaching our
boys to go in for games, we in a measure obviate this.
A man who is good at rowing or cricket or football has
had to some extent a soldier's training, and so will
probably possess a soldier's virtues."
</p>

<p>
"My son," said Mr. Seaton, "never say a word in
favour of war.  It is an invention of the devil, and no
good can ever come of it."
</p>

<p>
"Still, good has come of it," persisted Paul; "the
full-grown sons of a warlike State are neither women nor
children&mdash;they are essentially manly."
</p>

<p>
"Our idea of manliness is not the true one," said
Mr. Seaton; "physical courage has done so much for
man that it has won undue admiration from both barbarism
and civilization.  Yet it is but a savage's virtue
at the best."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true!" exclaimed Edgar Ford.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton continued: "My son has just pointed out
that war makes men the very opposite of women and
children.  There I agree with him.  But I cannot forget
that it is written: 'Except ye become as little children ye
shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven'."
</p>

<p>
"War is a terrible thing!" sighed Mrs. Ford, "I
never can understand how Wordsworth could write a
poem in favour of it."
</p>

<p>
"I expect he was sick of behaving prettily, and writing
about primroses and pet lambs and weathercocks, and
felt he should like to have a regular flare-up just for once
and shock every one," suggested Isabel, "I have often
felt like that myself."
</p>

<p>
Everybody laughed, and then the rector said to Paul:
"You are quite right in what you say about athletics
being a good antidote against fads."
</p>

<p>
"Fads being the ruin of any political party," added
Mr. Ford.
</p>

<p>
"But a man's duty to his own conscience comes
before his duty to the State," said Edgar; "and I cannot
see that any one is justified in defending a course of
action which he considers wrong, simply because his
party is pledged to that course."
</p>

<p>
"In politics, as in scene-painting," murmured
Mr. Madderley, "I suppose one has to consider general
effects rather than minute details."
</p>

<p>
"And the pre-Raphaelite school would not be effective
from a political standpoint," added Mr. Ford.
</p>

<p>
The artist shrugged his shoulders.  "I am not sure
that it is from an artistic one."
</p>

<p>
"Are you not?  Then I am afraid I shall have to
quarrel with you, Mr. Madderley," said his hostess.
</p>

<p>
"Then you will have to quarrel with the rector too,
and I will help you," remarked Mrs. Stoneley, "although
I have been a devoted wife to him for forty years, he
quarrels regularly with me every Academy because I
like looking at pictures that he says are without
perspective."
</p>

<p>
"I know the sort," cried Isabel, "dear little scriptural
things, like tame and domestic church-windows."
</p>

<p>
"It is just like men to bother about perspective,"
added Mrs. Stoneley, "they are so literal, poor dears! that
it is not safe to leave anything to their imaginations.
Besides you cannot leave anything to something which
does not exist."
</p>

<p>
The rector smiled.  "Pardon me, my love, this
consideration never hinders me from leaving many things to
your discretion."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Henry, you never heard me fussing about
perspective, whatever else I may have done."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, my love; a desire for perspective
presupposes a sense of proportion."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind him, Miss Carnaby," said his wife;
"you and I will go to the Academy together, and leave
him at home to study perspective from the rectory
windows."
</p>

<p>
The rector turned to Edgar.  "I think that the idea
of duty to one's own conscience is growing to abnormal
proportions, and is in great danger of degenerating into
a morbid and unhealthy egotism.  As far as my experience
goes, if a man fulfils his duty towards God and
his duty towards his neighbour, he will not have much
time left for works of supererogation."
</p>

<p>
"But are not one's duty towards God and one's duty
towards one's own conscience synonymous?" asked Edgar.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Stoneley thought for a moment.  "Not necessarily,
I should say.  One's duty towards God is clearly
defined in our good old Church catechism; but one's duty
towards one's own conscience is an elastic term, which
may include anything from religious persecution to
anti-vaccination."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford chuckled approvingly.  "Quite true!"
</p>

<p>
"As a distinguished politician once said: 'Politics is
the science of the second best,'" remarked Paul, "therefore
we must recognize the truth that in political strife
we can only approximately approach an ideal."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," agreed his host, "everything in this
world is a matter of compromise."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot admit that," cried Edgar with eagerness;
"to me, compromise is a detestable word.  It is our
business to aim at perfection, and to be satisfied with
nothing less.  The fact that we may fail in our endeavour
to attain our ideal, in no way lessens our obligation to
follow after it."
</p>

<p>
"But the danger is," said his mother, "that if we go
in for perfection or nothing, we shall in all probability get
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid we must all be content with the second
best in this world," remarked Mrs. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," added Isabel, "like the man who said that as
perfection in female beauty did not exist, he was looking
out for a wife who could cook a potato properly."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly half a loaf is better than no bread,"
suggested Paul.
</p>

<p>
Edgar shook his head.  "As long as people are
content with half loaves they will never get whole ones."
</p>

<p>
"First let them be sure that they want whole ones,"
suggested Mr. Madderley.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," cried Mrs. Stoneley.  "People spend half
their lives crying for things which would make them cry
still more if they got them."
</p>

<p>
"Whole loaves would be very fattening, in the first
place," continued the artist, "nothing would induce me
to take one."
</p>

<p>
"Are you afraid of getting fat?" inquired Isabel, "I
never think of it."
</p>

<p>
"This dread is the one cloud on my horizon, dear lady,
the one discord in my life's harmony.  You happy thin
people do not know what troubles flesh is heir to, nor
what fears."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think bread so dangerous?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"The most fattening thing in the world.  I had a
friend who said he once inadvertently asked for bread,
and he gained a stone in a week."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "Then let us be content with only
half a loaf; and, if we value our figures, we had better
have that toasted."
</p>

<p>
"Contentment is often only a euphemism for cowardice,"
said Edgar.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid S. Paul did not agree with you,"
remarked Mr. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
Edgar smiled; one of the reasons why he was so
lovable was that he never lost his temper nor turned
rusty in an argument.  "S. Paul added godliness to the
prescription, however, before he recommended it for
general use," he said pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton laughed.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," continued Edgar, "that to bind
oneself down to follow any particular party through thick
and thin, is to do despite to one's own individuality."
</p>

<p>
"You know nothing at all about it," exclaimed his
father.
</p>

<p>
The rector looked serious.  "Individualism carried to
excess soon becomes rebellion."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless," persisted Edgar, "it is one's duty
to do what we think right, regardless of results.  We
know what was said of them who did evil that good
might come; now we are afraid to do good lest evil may
come, and I think that our condemnation is as just as
theirs."
</p>

<p>
"I should be sorry to lead a party composed entirely
of Edgars," Paul remarked, "there would be a regular
Giants' Causeway of rocks ahead."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford nodded.  Paul's straightforward common
sense always appealed to him.
</p>

<p>
"There you go again!" cried Edgar.  "Caution is
your watchword, and it is a word I hate."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," agreed Isabel; "all the mistakes of my life
have arisen out of caution."
</p>

<p>
"So have all the successes of mine," added Mr. Ford
drily.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ford looked anxiously at Isabel.  "I trust that
your horror of caution does not extend to matters
affecting your health, my dear; it is never safe for any one to
run risks, and you do not look at all strong."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed, and Paul felt a sudden tightening of
the muscles round his heart, and a moment's unreasoning
hatred of Mrs. Ford.  Who does not know the bitter
loathing that we all feel when some one suggests to us
that our nearest and dearest are not looking well?  Such
speakers are probably kind, or, at worst, only careless;
but we hate them more than we hate the foes who wish
to injure us.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Ford has been looking after my health too,"
said the artist.
</p>

<p>
His hostess smiled.  "I only said I would not allow
him to work too hard while he was here, and I advised
him to take a glass of new milk at tea-time."
</p>

<p>
"The new milk is making a new man of me," said
Mr. Madderley, looking gratefully at Mrs. Ford for all his
quizzing.
</p>

<p>
"Now milk really is a fattening thing," Isabel said,
shaking her head, "so is water."
</p>

<p>
"Is it, dear lady?  I never take it."
</p>

<p>
"Then you ought to; I always do."
</p>

<p>
"The fairest flowers demand their dew," murmured
the artist, bowing to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"And artists&mdash;like poets and muses and people of that
sort&mdash;live upon nectar, I presume," she retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," replied Mr. Madderley, "it is always a
case of nectar or nothing with us."
</p>

<p>
"I know it is ignorant of me," said Joanna, "but I
always confuse nectar with manna."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," echoed Alice.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe that people would be satisfied with
manna now-a-days," said Isabel, "they would want
something more spicy than angels' food."
</p>

<p>
"Other times, other mannas," murmured the artist.
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed again; and Paul wondered how any
man could be such an idiot as to make puns.  He did not
quite realize that he would have laughed himself if Isabel
had not done so, and would have thought Madderley an
amusing fellow; but he did not like Isabel's evident
amusement at all.
</p>

<p>
The conversation flowed on pleasantly all through
dinner, and everybody was happy except Alice; but the
sight of Paul's obvious devotion to Isabel proved a large
fly in her ointment.  It did not make her wild with
jealousy as it would have made some women, nor hard
and bitter as it would have made others; it merely
reduced her to a humble and pitiful condition of mind, in
which she wanted her mother to comfort her&mdash;or else
another man to make love to her as Paul was making
love to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
It is so easy for a woman to create a new heaven and
a new earth for herself&mdash;especially the former&mdash;out of
whatever she may have at hand.  She must have a
heaven of some kind, however scanty may be the materials
wherewith she has to build; just as a little girl must have
a doll, if it be only a bundle of rags tied round with a
string.  But men do not understand this.  To them the
manufacture of the new heaven and the new earth is not
so simple; they cannot so easily sweep away the historical
ruins of their past, and erect a fresh fabric upon
the old foundations; for men are strong to do&mdash;and (still
harder task!) to do without.  They can live&mdash;after a
fashion&mdash;without a heaven at all; and would rather do so
than have a jerry-built edifice made up out of scraps they
have not themselves chosen.  But to women, poor souls! a
heaven of some kind is a necessity of their being; and
though the new one may not be formed after their ideal
pattern like the old, it is better than nothing, and will
probably in the end make them quite as happy.
</p>

<p>
Therefore Alice, feeling herself left out in the cold
when she saw Paul and Isabel together, was in the state
of mind that she would have accepted&mdash;and actually
fallen in love with&mdash;Edgar, had he availed himself of
these circumstances to propose to her.  But poor Edgar
had never learnt the art of making slaves out of
circumstances.  He was a good man and chivalrous, and he
always did the right thing&mdash;but he invariably chose the
wrong time for doing it.  Just then he felt particularly
tender towards Alice.  He saw that she saw how Paul's
face softened at the sight of Isabel; and he realized that
every sign of affection shown towards Isabel by Paul was
a fresh thorn in Alice's path.  Edgar argued that if he
lost Alice, no other woman could comfort him; and that
therefore, Alice having lost Paul, no other man could
comfort her.  He forgot that love to a man is like
health&mdash;he can exist after a fashion without it, though he
cannot attain to a high standard of happiness; but that love
to a woman is like life&mdash;she must have it, in some form
or another, or else she will die.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to notice that the men who happen to
be in love, always join the ladies in advance of the others;
consequently Paul and Edgar did not sit long over their
wine.  Paul went straight up to Isabel; and Edgar&mdash;with
his ready instinct to help anybody who was hurt&mdash;asked
Alice to come and see a new and rare orchid that
was in the conservatory.  After they had duly admired
the orchid, they sat down beside the cool marble fountain.
Edgar longed to take Alice in his arms and kiss her, she
looked so pretty and so sorrowful; but instead of that he
began to talk about the Sidbury election.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be sorry if the Tory has got in," he said, "it
will vex my father, and I cannot bear to see him
disappointed.  He spoke at Sidbury last week, and made
such a capital speech."
</p>

<p>
"Did he?" said Alice.  She was wondering whether
Paul would have loved her if she had been as clever as
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"But though it grieves me to see him disappointed,"
continued Edgar, "I am afraid it will some day be my
duty to disappoint him more than any one.  It will nearly
break my heart, and yet I fear I shall be obliged to do it."
</p>

<p>
"How dreadfully sad!" murmured Alice.  She was
thinking that after all Isabel was not nearly as good-looking
as she was, and that most men consider beauty far
more important than brains in a woman.
</p>

<p>
"It is cruel work, Alice, when one's duty and one's
affections clash!  I sometimes wonder if my duty to my
father is not more binding than my duty to my own
conscience; yet if I acted as I thought wrongly, in order not
to vex my father, I fancy such a course would be the
doing of evil that good might come."
</p>

<p>
Alice sighed.  "I expect it would."  She was wishing
she had been clever instead of pretty; it seemed to pay
better in the long run after all.
</p>

<p>
Edgar went on: "I cannot help feeling that political
life in a measure blunts one's finer perceptions and lowers
one's ideals.  Of course I see, with my father, that from
the party point of view a certain amount of unanimity is
imperative; but from the personal point of view I cannot
see that a man is justified in sacrificing his own
principles&mdash;and the expression of them&mdash;to any consideration
whatever."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," said Alice.  She was wondering if
Paul talked to Isabel about political and personal points
of view, and if Isabel had any idea what it all meant.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Alice, the Sermon on the Mount is as
binding now as it was eighteen centuries ago; yet who
now gives his cloak to them that take his coat; or who
strives to be meek and merciful and poor in spirit?"
</p>

<p>
Alice looked at Edgar.  He was a handsomer man
than Paul and much more religious; she wondered she
did not like him as well.
</p>

<p>
"It is very difficult for me to talk about the things I
really care for," he continued, his eyes bright with
excitement.  "I never do it to anybody except you, but you
are different from everybody else.  I cannot reconcile to
my conscience the present attitude of the rich towards
the poor&mdash;that is what troubles me so much."
</p>

<p>
"Does it?  I am so sorry," said Alice gently.  She
was grieved for Edgar to be unhappy, but she wondered
that he let a trifle such as this make him so.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I cannot get it out of my mind.  When the
charge is brought against us, 'I was a stranger and ye
took Me not in,' do you think it will be enough to answer:
'Lord, there were the workhouses and the poor rates;
and indiscriminate charity was supposed to pauperize
the lower classes'?"
</p>

<p>
Alice shook her head.  "Of course not."
</p>

<p>
"Then what ought we to do?&mdash;or rather, what ought
I to do?  For it is my own beam that I must be looking
after, and not my brother's mote.  Oh!  Alice, I think of
this night and day, and yet I come to no satisfactory
conclusion."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Edgar!"  Alice was really sympathetic now.
Conversation about politics did not interest her; it was
completely over her head.  But here was a man in
trouble, crying out for help and comfort; this she
understood well enough, and her woman's heart longed to
comfort him.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot bear to grieve my father," sighed Edgar;
"he has always been such a good father to me."
</p>

<p>
"And you have always been such a good son to him."
</p>

<p>
"I have tried to be; but that is not enough.  The
young man in the gospels had evidently been a good son,
as he had kept all the commandments.  Nevertheless he
was called upon to sell all that he had and give to the
poor."
</p>

<p>
"But there are lots of good men who don't sell all
they have to give to the poor," suggested Alice, "and
yet there is no doubt that they are quite as religious as
you are, and quite as conscientious."
</p>

<p>
"I see that," agreed Edgar, "but every one is not
called upon to make the same sacrifice.  A man who is
called to preach the gospel, has no right to disregard
that call because some other man has not received it.
We are each appointed to our separate work; and each
man has got to do his own work, and not somebody else's
because he thinks that would suit him better."
</p>

<p>
"Alice," called Mrs. Ford from the drawing-room;
"come and give us some of your charming music, my dear."
</p>

<p>
So Alice went to the piano and sang "Robin Adair," in
a voice to which Nature had given sweetness, and Sorrow
had added expression.  While she sang, Edgar felt a
lump in his throat, and again longed to take her in
his arms and console her; and Isabel's eyes filled with
tears as she realized that what made London balls so fine
and crowded assemblies so brilliant, was the presence of
Paul Seaton; while Paul himself hoped that Alice's song
would soon be over, so that he might go on talking to
Isabel.

CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
The Country of Conceit.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Safe screened by hills on either hand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From winter storms and summer heat,<br>
  There lies a silly little land&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Country of Conceit.<br>
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, not long after Isabel's visit to
Chayford, Paul was having tea at the Farleys'
house in Prince's Gate; and Lady Esdaile
was there also, looking prettier than ever.
Paul was feeling particularly happy, as he had done ever
since Isabel had made herself at home among his own
people; she had fulfilled even his ideal of her, and
consequently he was content.  He had yet to learn that the
fact of a woman's being an angel in May, is no ground for
supposing that she will be equally angelic in June&mdash;or even
angelic at all.  Isabel&mdash;with her fatal aptitude for taking
her tone from her surroundings&mdash;was as earthly in London
as she had been heavenly at Chayford; that is to say, the
outward and visible Isabel was; and poor Paul, with all his
love for her, as yet lacked the wisdom to understand her
thoroughly.  It always seems a pity, with regard to
lovemaking, that when people are old enough to have learnt
the game properly, they are generally too old to want to
play at it.  In this respect it is inferior to whist.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't London adorable just now?" exclaimed Isabel.
"Everything is in such a rush that one has not time to
think about anything."
</p>

<p>
"Rather a doubtful advantage, I should say,"
suggested Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  I hate thinking, it makes my head
ache," replied Isabel flippantly.
</p>

<p>
Paul looked surprised and puzzled; was this the same
woman who had sat beside him in Chayford Chapel and
sung "There is a land of pure delight"?  He did not
know that Isabel's character was as yet so unformed that
she was frightened at the depth of her own feelings, and
that this was a feeble protest on her part against an
emotion that was threatening to overwhelm her.
</p>

<p>
Lady Esdaile shook her head.  "Mr. Seaton is right;
it is shocking not to have time to think.  The other day
I was actually putting on a gown for the Wallingfords'
dinner that I had worn there once before, simply
because I was in such a hurry that I had not time to give
proper attention to my wardrobe.  Fortunately my maid
happened to remember in time.  But think how awful
it would have been if I had worn the same dress at the
same house twice in one season!"
</p>

<p>
"Dreadful!" agreed Isabel.  "It is wonderful what
an effect clothes have on one's character.  Personally I
have not the courage to show myself if I do not feel I am
suitably attired; a characteristic which I inherit from my
first parents."
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley laughed.  "I think our conversation is
greatly affected by our clothes," she remarked.  "I can
never administer a social snub properly unless I am
wearing either fur or diamonds; and I couldn't possibly pray
in a hat, or without a veil."
</p>

<p>
"I quite agree with you, Caroline," said Lady Esdaile;
"I cannot bear to see a married woman of my age in
church in a hat.  And yet the unmarried ones look all
right.  Isn't it funny that a little thing like getting
married should make all the difference between wearing a
hat or a bonnet on Sunday?"
</p>

<p>
"Very funny," replied Lady Farley, "but great effects
do result from small causes, Constance."
</p>

<p>
"They certainly do; I came upon an instance of that
only the other day.  The Featherstonehaughs' cook died
suddenly, and so Mabel Featherstonehaugh was sent off
straight to the Ellisons', as anything of that kind in a
house is so unpleasant, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is," remarked Lady Farley, with her
satirical smile.
</p>

<p>
Lady Esdaile continued: "Willie Philipson happened
to be staying at the Ellisons' at the same time, and was so
taken with Mabel that I shouldn't be surprised if he made
her an offer.  It would be an awfully good match for her;
and yet if the Featherstonehaughs' cook had not happened
to die just then, she and Willie might never have met
each other."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed; this speech was so exactly like Lady
Esdaile and its flippancy did not irritate him at all.  But
he was conscious that if Isabel had said such a thing
he would have felt more angry than he could express.
Isabel also was conscious of this, and resented it.  She
argued that if Paul really cared for her, he would approve
of everything she said and did; Paul, on the contrary,
argued that because he really cared for her, it was agony
to him when she said and did the things that he did not
approve of; consequently (in speaking of a woman the
word consequently is applicable here&mdash;had it been a man
that was referred to, such an expression as strange to say
would have been better)&mdash;consequently Isabel ran full
tilt against all Paul's prejudices and theories.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Caroline is right in saying that our conversation
depends upon our clothes," she said, "mine is entirely
guided by them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, it isn't," ejaculated Paul, "you are talking
nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, my dear sir, I am not; I must know better
than you do what are the sources of my own wit.  Have
you never noticed that I am subdued in black, poetical in
blue, innocent in green, and brilliant in yellow?"
</p>

<p>
"And what in white?" asked Lady Esdaile with interest.
</p>

<p>
"White I never wear, Aunt Constance, for the dual
reason that my hairs are dark and my years are many."
</p>

<p>
"But it is so economical," persisted Lady Esdaile;
"if you wear white, people never remember it."
</p>

<p>
"And they never remember me either," added Isabel,
"I look so very plain in it."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid we are shocking Mr. Seaton," said Lady
Esdaile sweetly, "he looks so serious.  But that is the
worst of men; they despise us if we try to look nice, and
they ignore us if we don't."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Lady Esdaile, we are not quite as bad as that."
</p>

<p>
Lady Esdaile sighed.  "Yes, you are.  And then,
again, you hate us for getting old, and you laugh at us
for trying to keep young.  You really are tiresome
creatures!"
</p>

<p>
Paul was amused.  "I own we are hard upon you
when you tell fibs about your ages, because such fibbing
seems so foolish to us.  When will women learn to be
as proud of being old as they are now of being young?"
</p>

<p>
"When men admire old women as much as young
ones, and not a moment before," replied Isabel smartly.
</p>

<p>
Every one laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I believe men really care as much about their clothes
as we do about ours," continued Lady Esdaile, "only
they don't talk about them as much.  But that is because
they are so reserved and queer.  I've noticed men never
talk about what they are thinking about.  Isn't it funny
of them?  I expect it is because they are so clever, they
can hide what they feel."
</p>

<p>
"The fools care about their clothes; but the clever
ones are too clever to see that they are not clever enough
to be independent of trifles," said Isabel, throwing the
gauntlet down before Paul.
</p>

<p>
But he was too wise to pick it up just then, though
he knew perfectly well that it was there.
</p>

<p>
So she rattled on: "I wonder if it would be possible
for a woman to love a man well enough to condone his
excellencies and to pardon his virtues.  Love has
accomplished some wonderful parlour-tricks, I admit; but I
don't think it has ever gone so far as to throw a halo
round a man with a conscience."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you?" said Paul drily, "I fancy you somewhat
underrate the powers of the little blind god, and
overrate the folly of your own sex."
</p>

<p>
"Don't have too much faith in my own sex," advised
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Do not quarrel, my children," murmured Lady
Farley; "the weather is too warm for anything but
peace."
</p>

<p>
Lady Esdaile rose; she always left the room when
any signs of a storm were brewing, and therefore had the
character of being a peacemaker.  "I must be going,"
she said, "I have so many calls to pay this afternoon.
Good-bye, dear people."
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley went downstairs with her sister-in-law,
and left the lovers to themselves.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence, and then Paul asked:
"Whatever possessed you to talk such nonsense as you
have been doing this afternoon?  You didn't mean a
word of it."
</p>

<p>
Isabel pouted.  She did not like to be scolded; she
was not accustomed to it.  "I did mean it.  I'd as soon
talk to a man with a hobby as a man with a conscience.
They are both boring."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't; and you do yourself an injustice when
you say things like that."
</p>

<p>
Isabel felt really cross; now and then Paul's superiority
irritated her, and she kicked against it.  This was one of
the occasions.
</p>

<p>
"I wish a touch of human nature was added to the
thousand and one excellencies which beset you," she
said; "it would make you more amusing in this world,
without in the least interfering with your chances for the
next."
</p>

<p>
"I am human enough, goodness knows!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, my dear sir; believe me, you flatter yourself.
You are a <i>rechauffÃ©</i> of King Arthur and Jack the Giant-killer,
flavoured to taste with extracts from the <i>Fairchild
Family</i>."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled somewhat grimly.  "Nevertheless you
were kind enough to select me as your future husband."
</p>

<p>
"Not 'unless I might have another for working-days;
your grace is too costly to wear every day,' but you will
be just the thing for Sundays."
</p>

<p>
"You are very cross this afternoon," said Paul, trying
to be pleasant, "but now you are coming for a walk with
me, and that will do you good."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked surprised.  "Why not?  You said that
you were."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay I did; but I have changed my mind."
</p>

<p>
"But why?  It is such a lovely afternoon, and it is now
cool enough for walking."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked at Paul from under her long eyelashes.
He had been disagreeable, and she felt it her duty to
punish him; she was a strict disciplinarian where her
lover was concerned, and never let her own feelings hinder
her from giving him such chastisement as she thought
needful.  To do them justice, however, it is but fair to
add that her feelings were very accommodating in this
respect, and rarely attempted to stand between Paul and
the consequences of his misdeeds; on the contrary, they
rather enjoyed the fulfilment of the decrees of inexorable
justice.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to go out this afternoon, because Lord
Wrexham said he might call," she replied.
</p>

<p>
Inexorable justice was satisfied.  The sentence&mdash;if
out of proportion to the crime&mdash;was exactly suited to the
criminal.  Isabel was a connoisseur in punishments.
</p>

<p>
The victim was silent for a moment, then he said:
"You ought not to have made any engagement for this
afternoon, after you had promised to go out with me; your
time was not your own".
</p>

<p>
"I don't care whose it was; anyhow I mean to take
it and use it as I like."
</p>

<p>
"But you have no right to."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "Bah! who talks about rights
now-a-days?  Nobody has really any right to anything,
except sufficient earth to bury them.  I shall do what I
want."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you mean to say you want to stay in and
see Lord Wrexham?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Confound him!" said Paul savagely.
</p>

<p>
"There! you are human after all," cried Isabel
triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"I always said I was.  It was you that stated the
opposite, if you remember.  There is no doubt that the
point is now proved beyond dispute, but it is my
statement that you have supported, not your own."
</p>

<p>
"I think jealousy is a disgusting fault," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I think so too, but that doesn't cure it.  At any rate
you will admit that it is extremely human."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head sorrowfully, though she was
really enjoying herself immensely.  "It is very wrong
and horrid and so like a man.  I believe the reason why
Paradise was Paradise to Adam was because he was the
only man on the ground."
</p>

<p>
"Very probably; and the old Adam is so strong in
me&mdash;in spite of your remarks to the contrary&mdash;that I
mean to be the only man on the ground, too."
</p>

<p>
"You've got a horrid temper, Paul; you are like the
man who always quarrelled with people till they liked
him.  You will never make anybody do what you want, if
you go on in that way."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes, I shall.  There is only one person in the
world that I wish to do what I want, and she will do it
in twenty minutes from now."
</p>

<p>
Isabel tossed her head.  "Oh! dear no, she won't."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! dear yes, she will."
</p>

<p>
"How shall you make her?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall not <i>make</i> her; she will do what I wish her to
do, partly because it is right, but chiefly because I wish
it and she wishes to please me."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's face grew very red.  "You are simply vile
and detestable and altogether horrid!"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite aware of that, and therefore it is all the
more wonderful that a woman who is simply delightful
and brilliant and altogether charming should be ready to
do as I wish."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shrugged her shoulders.  "Nothing will induce
me to go out this afternoon&mdash;nothing!"
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled and was silent.
</p>

<p>
Isabel stamped her foot.  "I am not going to walk
about London with a nasty disagreeable man, and I tell
you so, once for all."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked at his watch.  "Sixteen minutes before
we start; I do not want to hurry you, but I know you
like plenty of time to tie your veil and to see that your
hair is all right."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked very cross.  "You are the most
detestable man I ever met!"
</p>

<p>
"That may be; but, as I remarked before, your feeling
is what the old hymn terms 'well-dissembled'."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I do hate you."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  If this is hatred I am well content with
it, and I would not change places with the people whom
you love for worlds."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked at herself in the glass.  "If there is one
thing I despise more than another," she remarked to her
reflection, "it is a woman who does what a man tells
her."
</p>

<p>
Again Paul found refuge in silence and smiles.
</p>

<p>
Isabel hummed a tune out of <i>Patience</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve minutes before we start," said Paul, <i>Ã  propos</i>
of nothing.
</p>

<p>
Isabel stole a look at him.  "What should you do if
I didn't go?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Paul pulled his moustache to hide a smile.  "You
would soon see what I should do," he said cautiously.
He had learned that the terrors of the Unknown evaporate
with fuller knowledge, so he did not enlighten Isabel;
moreover he would have found a difficulty in so doing, as
he did not know himself.
</p>

<p>
"What should you do?" she persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Like 'the story of Auld Grouse in the gun-room,'
my programme is all the more effective for not being
told."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you know what you would do."
</p>

<p>
"Don't I though?"  And there was laughter in Paul's
eyes.  "Besides," he added; "what is the use of
providing for impossible contingencies?"
</p>

<p>
"It is the impossible that always happens," said
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Except when it is the unexpected," corrected Paul.
</p>

<p>
Isabel pulled a yellow rose out of her belt, and began
picking it to pieces.  "Why are you so keen on making
me go out with you this afternoon?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because I want to enjoy the pleasure of being with
you, and because every man has a right to his own."
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't care about my pleasure?"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me; I care so much about it that if I thought
it really was a greater pleasure to you to stay in and see
Lord Wrexham than to go out with me, I would never
ask you to go out with me again.  But I don't think so,
and that makes all the difference."
</p>

<p>
"You are jealous of Lord Wrexham; that is the long
and short of it," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Possibly," replied Paul drily.
</p>

<p>
"I never heard such rubbish!"  And Isabel plucked
at the rose with impatient fingers.
</p>

<p>
Paul looked at his watch again.  "Just five minutes,"
he murmured, as if to himself.
</p>

<p>
"I hate you!" cried Isabel stamping her foot.
</p>

<p>
"I know; you said so a short time ago, and I told
you that your hatred was the best thing in life, if you
remember.  Repetition is not argument, my dear Isabel."
</p>

<p>
Isabel did not answer; but, in spite of her hatred,
she ran upstairs and put her hat and gloves on, and was
down again before the twenty minutes had elapsed.  And
she did not know that while she was out of the room
Paul picked up the remnants of the rose she had played
with, and kissed them before he slipped them into his
pocket-book.
</p>

<p>
People generally called Paul Seaton a hard man.
They would have changed their opinion if they had seen
his face when he kissed Isabel's shattered rose.  But
Paul was not the sort of man to kiss roses when there
was any chance of being seen.
</p>

<p>
When Isabel came downstairs she looked so nice that
Paul pursued the same course of treatment with her that
he had pursued with the yellow rose; and with even
greater satisfaction, to judge by the expression of his
face.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you like me so awfully?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because you are you, and because you are mine."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't we been horrid to each other this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "I have been horrid, but you are never
anything but charming, sweetheart."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I know I'm none the less charming for being
horrid sometimes; and&mdash;to tell the truth&mdash;neither are
you.  I believe that we are both nicest when we are
nasty, and that when we hate each other we love each
other the most."
</p>

<p>
Then they both laughed and went out and walked
along the unfrequented and grassy ways of the park.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to the Fulfords' to-night?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"No; they haven't asked me.  Are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if you are not; I hate the parties that you
don't go to.  To adapt an old bull, you spoil half the
parties by not being asked to them."
</p>

<p>
Paul shrugged his shoulders.  "It is my misfortune
and not my fault; for I am green with jealousy of every
living soul who is invited to a party where there is a chance
of meeting you."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it funny," said Isabel meditatively, "how one
person can make such a lot of difference?  Paul Seaton
goes away for a day or two, and London becomes as
sparsely populated as the steppes of Russia and as
desolate as the Great Sahara; Paul Seaton comes back
again, and the place is as crowded as if it were the scene
of a Jubilee procession or a royal wedding."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Paul simply.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to bring out a new arithmetic book,"
continued Isabel, "with problems such as these: Take one
from five millions and only one remains&mdash;and that one
is yourself and very lonely."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed, and Isabel rattled on: "Add one to
two, and the result is still two; for the one is sadly <i>de
trop</i>, and so is shaken off as soon as possible".
</p>

<p>
"What a clever mathematician it is!" said Paul fondly.
</p>

<p>
"You are rather a swell at mathematics yourself,
aren't you?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't bad at them when I was at Oxford."
</p>

<p>
"Yet, my dear Paul, you are very slow at putting
two and two together.  I have often noticed it."
</p>

<p>
"Because that is a higher branch than those in
which I was proficient.  But wherein have I failed lately
to satisfy the examiners on this score?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't always understand women&mdash;me, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Do not blame Oxford for that; there was nothing
in the least like you in the mathematics that I studied
at the 'Varsity.  They were dull, stupid things, with
reason in them."
</p>

<p>
"How horrid!"
</p>

<p>
"And when you put two and two together they
invariably came to four," continued Paul, "can you
imagine anything more tame and uninteresting?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  Now what is the result of putting two
and two together when you are dealing with me?"
</p>

<p>
Paul thought for a moment; then he said: "Sometimes
five and sometimes a million; one can never tell;
all one can tell for certain is that the result never will
be four.  The only conclusion it is never safe to arrive
at in dealing with a woman is the only logical one."
</p>

<p>
"Which do you like best&mdash;me or mathematics?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, what an absurd question!"
</p>

<p>
"Which do you?" persisted Isabel.
</p>

<p>
Paul grew serious.  "When I was at Oxford I liked
classics better than mathematics, and rowing better
than both of them; after I left the 'Varsity, I began to
care about power and success and fame more than about
rowing; now I love you more than power and success
and fame put together, with all the kingdoms of the
world thrown in."
</p>

<p>
"My dear old boy!"
</p>

<p>
"I only want to succeed now, in order that I may
have the more to offer to you," continued Paul, "I feel
that money is worth getting because it will give you
ease; power, because it will give you rank; and fame,
because it will give you pleasure.  I used to care for
these things for their own sake, now I only care for
them for yours; and consequently I care ten times
more for them than I used to do, and am ten times
more keen on winning them.  By Jove! if only I had
Edgar Ford's chances, wouldn't I make my wife one of
the most envied women in London!"
</p>

<p>
"Yet Edgar will never do much," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I know he won't; that is the pity of it.  If I were
in Edgar's place, with all his advantages, I would be in
the Government before I was forty.  As for him, he will
either not go into Parliament at all, or else throw up
all chance of office by figuring as an independent member.
As if a great empire could be governed by a bundle of
fads!"
</p>

<p>
"Edgar is really an ascetic," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Edgar is really an ass," said Paul.
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "He is a perfect angel in
some things."
</p>

<p>
"And a perfect ass in others," repeated her lover.
</p>

<p>
"It is not always easy to tell the difference between
an ass and an angel," remarked Isabel; "it confused
Balaam a good deal, don't you remember?  When he
thought that it was only an ass that was hindering him
on his journey, it turned out to be really the angel of
the Lord.  And Balaam's is not an uncommon mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Sweetheart, you are ingenious."
</p>

<p>
"I was only trying to keep you from repeating
Balaam's blunder."
</p>

<p>
Paul sighed.  "It is the sort of blunder to which
I am prone; I should have been irritated with the
creature, if I had been Balaam."
</p>

<p>
"I know you would; you are always so sure of
yourself, and you cannot bear to be thwarted."
</p>

<p>
"But you shall be my angel, dear, and always stand
in the way when you think I am wrong.  You could turn
me back from anything, Isabel."
</p>

<p>
"But you like Edgar, don't you?" Isabel asked.
</p>

<p>
"Like him?  I should think I do.  I consider he is
one of the best fellows under the sun, and I have the
greatest respect as well as affection for him.  But I
cannot help thinking that he uses the microscope too
much and the telescope too little, figuratively speaking."
</p>

<p>
"I know what you mean."
</p>

<p>
Paul went on: "He so strains his moral eyesight
with splitting hairs, that he is incapable of taking in a
large general effect; and he is apt to confuse prejudices
with principles, and crotchets with creeds.  He is not
content with conforming to the spirit of the law; he will
obey it in the letter as well."
</p>

<p>
"I do not think you are just to Edgar," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Possibly not.  I am so much impressed by the necessity
of attaining what is good, and the impossibility
of rising to what is perfect, that it irritates me to see
men neglecting an obvious duty for the sake of an
impracticable dream."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think there is any danger of this in
theoretical people?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," replied Paul.  "Of course I know that it is
better to build a cathedral than to make a boot; but I
think it is better to actually make a boot, than only to
dream about building a cathedral.  It is far nobler to do
great things than small things, I admit; but it is nobler
to do small things than to waste all one's time in wanting
to do great ones, and to end by doing nothing at all."
</p>

<p>
"Edgar certainly is a theorist."
</p>

<p>
"Edgar was born several centuries too late," continued
Paul, "in the early days of Christianity he would
have been an heroic martyr; in the middle ages, a
cloistered saint; just after the Reformation, a consistent
Puritan; at the time of the evangelical revival, an ideal
early Methodist; but in the nineteenth century&mdash;as the
intellectual son of a wealthy merchant&mdash;there seems no
place for him."
</p>

<p>
"You and I, on the contrary, are very modern, aren't
we, Paul?  Old-fashioned things&mdash;such as wigs and cowls
and martyrdoms&mdash;would not have been at all becoming to
us."
</p>

<p>
And then the lovers fell to talking about themselves,
and forgot Edgar and everybody else in their absorption
in the subject under discussion.

CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
Expulsion from Eden.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You took my heart and made it beat,<br>
  Then trampled it beneath your feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched its cracks and creases.<br>
  Unless I make a great mistake,<br>
  A heart thus hurt was bound to break;<br>
  So say no more, for pity's sake,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sweep up all the pieces.<br>
</p>

<p>
When the season was at its height it
unfortunately happened that Isabel's evil genius
made the suggestion that Paul was growing
too headstrong and masterful, and prescribed
a good dose of jealousy as a cure for this complaint.  Of
course Isabel should have known better than to listen to
such dangerous promptings, and should forthwith have
silenced the lying spirit by her faith in her lover and in
his love for her.  But no mortal is wise at all times&mdash;not
even when the mortal happens to be a woman; and this
was a time of unwisdom on Isabel's part.
</p>

<p>
"Paul is too sure of your love," whispered Isabel's
evil genius, "now that you are always nice to him he
takes your niceness as a matter of course."
</p>

<p>
"Paul is right to be sure of my love," replied Isabel's
better self, "it is a poor trick to try to enhance the value
of anything by pretending that its existence is precarious."
</p>

<p>
"There is no good in having power if you never use
it," argued the evil genius.
</p>

<p>
"There is no good in having love if you ever abuse
it," answered the better self.
</p>

<p>
"Paul is not nearly as fond of you as he was at first.
</p>

<p>
"Paul loves me as much as ever, and it is a shame to
doubt him."
</p>

<p>
"If he is as fond of you as he was, why has he ceased
to look black when you speak to another man?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he knows that I love him and he trusts me."
</p>

<p>
Then the evil genius whispered: "Do you think it
would be possible to make him as jealous as he used to
be?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure it would, but nothing would induce me to try."
</p>

<p>
"Still it would be an interesting experiment&mdash;just to
see for certain if he does love you as much as ever,"
suggested the evil genius.
</p>

<p>
This argument in Isabel's inner consciousness
continued for several days; and the result of it was
that&mdash;at a dance at the Gordons'&mdash;Isabel flirted outrageously
with Mr. Madderley.  Paul took it very well at first; he
had perfect confidence in Isabel, and he knew that it does
not do to pull the reins too tight.  Isabel noticed that he
took it very well, and put his endurance down to indifference;
consequently she flirted harder than ever.
</p>

<p>
By an almost superhuman effort, Paul refrained from
saying a word to Isabel on the subject, and succeeded in
being quite kind and courteous when he bade her good-night,
though he was in a fury of jealous misery underneath
his calm exterior.
</p>

<p>
Isabel felt certain that such calmness showed that he
did not care, and cried herself to sleep that night.
</p>

<p>
Paul argued that he owed it to Isabel to conceal his
anguish.
</p>

<p>
Isabel argued that he owed it to her to reveal it.
</p>

<p>
Paul knew that you do not talk about a thing if it
really hurts you.
</p>

<p>
Isabel knew that if a thing really hurts you, you
cannot talk about anything else.
</p>

<p>
All through the following day this wretched state of
things continued.
</p>

<p>
Paul was pale and quiet, and longed to throw himself
into the Serpentine.
</p>

<p>
Isabel was flushed and brilliant, and talked to Lord
Wrexham and Mr. Madderley in the Row.
</p>

<p>
Paul hoped that he might be kept from kicking Lord
Wrexham and Mr. Madderley.
</p>

<p>
Isabel prayed that she might be kept from crying until
she reached home.
</p>

<p>
Isabel thought that there was nothing in the world
that mattered except love, but felt she would die sooner
than let Paul see how much she cared for him.
</p>

<p>
Paul thought that there was nothing in the world that
mattered except Isabel, but couldn't for the life of him
imagine what had come to her.
</p>

<p>
Isabel decided that the only dignified course was to
let Paul think she had ceased to love him.
</p>

<p>
Paul decided that the only honourable course was to
give Isabel her freedom.
</p>

<p>
That night Isabel again cried herself to sleep, and
Paul never went to sleep at all.
</p>

<p>
The next morning they both felt better, and repaired
to Kensington Gardens on the chance of a meeting.  Each
was in a more reasonable and amiable frame of mind, and
quite prepared to forgive the other if that other made an
adequate show of penitence.
</p>

<p>
It was unfortunate, however, that neither had studied
the part of the one to be forgiven.
</p>

<p>
Paul made up his mind that he would be patient with
Isabel, and would not lose his temper however provoking
she might be; so he began quite gently&mdash;after the customary
greetings: "Look here, Isabel, I don't want to say
anything nasty, because nasty words always leave a scar
behind; but I wish you would not go on in the way you
have done just lately.  It isn't fair to me, but that is of
small consequence; what really matters is that it isn't
fair to yourself, for it makes people say horrid things
about you; and that is the one thing that I cannot and
will not bear."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked surprised.  This was a funny beginning for
a penitential confession.  "I don't know what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes, you do, dear," said Paul patiently.
</p>

<p>
Isabel was annoyed; she did not like being called over
the coals as if she were a tiresome schoolgirl.  "Oh! no,
I don't.  And anyhow I don't flirt worse than half the
women in London."
</p>

<p>
"That is nothing to do with me, Isabel; I don't care
a hang how much other women are talked about&mdash;I only
care for what people say of you.  Believe me, I am not
blaming you, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Blaming me?&mdash;I should think not!" exclaimed Isabel
angrily.  How could any self-respecting woman forgive a
man who talked about not blaming her?
</p>

<p>
"I only want to save you from doing things in a
moment of temper that I know you will regret
afterwards," added Paul.
</p>

<p>
Isabel's face flushed.  "I can take care of myself,
thank you; I knew how to behave, even before I had the
inestimable privilege of learning manners from Mr. Paul
Seaton."
</p>

<p>
Still Paul kept his temper.  "You know, darling, you
have been awfully rough on me the last few days; but I'll
forgive you like a shot, and never say another word about
it, if you will promise not to go on like that again."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Isabel pertly.  "I notice that as
long as a clever woman is content to sit at a man's feet
and say, 'This is the only man in the whole world,' that
man thinks he enjoys the society of clever women; but
if the clever woman happens to indulge in an opinion not
implanted by him, he calls her unwomanly, and he pines
for amiable stupidity."
</p>

<p>
"That is not fair, Isabel; I detest amiable stupidity."
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't; you really like it."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel, this is absurd, and you know it is."
</p>

<p>
Isabel felt absolutely sure now that Paul did not
really care; an ideal lover would have been in a frenzy
of agony at her anger, she thought, instead of taking it
in this calm, superior way.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you'd like me to be shut up like a Turkish
woman, and never speak to any man but you!"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not; but, all the same, I am not going to
have my promised wife flirting with a lot of other men,
and I tell you so.  As I have said before, there are some
things which a man would sooner renounce than share."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shrugged her shoulders.  "You really have got
a most detestable temper."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel, don't, for pity's sake, go on like this.  There
is nothing in reason that I would not do or bear for you,
but it is possible to try a man too far."
</p>

<p>
"It strikes me there is precious little that you would
do or bear for me, in spite of all your talk."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked very stern.  "Do you really mean that?"
</p>

<p>
By this time Isabel had lashed herself into a perfect
fury.  "Yes, I do mean it; you are so proud and
self-centred that you only care for what enhances your own
importance.  You are pleased to be engaged to a smart
woman, because it reflects credit on yourself; but for the
feelings of the woman underneath her smartness, you
don't care a rap."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel, be careful what you say."
</p>

<p>
"No, I shan't be careful.  I am tired of being careful
and of considering your feelings, when you never show
the slightest consideration for mine.  You are hard and
cold and selfish&mdash;that is what you are&mdash;and it is time you
knew it!  You never really loved me; you admired me,
because I was showy, and you thought that a showy wife
would help you in your career; but you never loved me
as a woman&mdash;only as one of the steps by which you could
mount to success."
</p>

<p>
Paul's face was very white.  "How dare you say such
things to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I think them.  You are precious careful,
forsooth, for fear people should talk about me, because
you think such talk is in some measure derogatory to you;
but you are pretty careless as to what you say to me, as
you know that whatever you say, it will be none the worse
for yourself.  You only care for me and my reputation as
an adjunct to your own importance."
</p>

<p>
"If you were a man, I should say you lied."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, you wouldn't.  You dare not say half the
nasty things to a man that you say to me."
</p>

<p>
"If you had been a man I should have silenced you
long ago."
</p>

<p>
By this time Isabel was very angry with herself, and
consequently ten times angrier with Paul; so she
continued recklessly: "As long as you only thought I
liked the other men better than you, you didn't care; it
was only when you began to think I was bringing discredit
on you, that you thought it necessary to make such a
fuss".
</p>

<p>
"Isabel, once for all listen to me."  Paul's voice was
so ominously quiet that a wiser woman&mdash;or even a foolish
woman who was not in a temper&mdash;would have taken
warning; but Isabel possessed the dangerous gift of a
vivid imagination; and what was once humorously said
of faith may be literally said of imagination, namely that
"it makes people believe what they know to be false".
</p>

<p>
"I won't listen to you and I won't be dictated to by
you," she retorted, goading herself to still further fury by
her own words; "if you had your own way, you would
make a perfect slave of me, and trample me under foot.
But I won't stand it."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel, you are very cruel and very unjust; have you
no consideration for my feelings?"
</p>

<p>
"Not I.  Why should I, when you have none for
mine?  You seem to think that feelings are a sign of
exquisite refinement peculiar to yourself, and you are so
busy seeing that everybody fulfils their duty to you, that
you have no time to think of your duty to other people."
</p>

<p>
"We have had enough of this," said Paul, rising from
his seat.
</p>

<p>
"More than enough, I should say."
</p>

<p>
"Still I have one question to ask.  Did you mean it
when you said that I only cared for you as a
stepping-stone to my own success?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel tossed her head.  "Of course I meant it; you
never care for anything or anybody that does not minister
to your own pride."
</p>

<p>
Paul's face was white, and his voice shook.  "Then I
have only one thing to say before I go out of your life
altogether.  I will not profane my love for you by talking
about it to a woman who would grow tired of any lover
as soon as his novelty had worn off; but I wish you
to understand that I will neither see you nor speak to
you, nor hold any communication with you, till you ask
my forgiveness for having so insulted me, and till you
retract that cruel untruth which in your heart of hearts
you know to be untrue as well as I do."
</p>

<p>
Isabel drew herself to her full height, and her eyes
blazed.  It showed how little Paul really loved her, she
thought, that he could give her up so easily.  "Then you
will never see me nor speak to me again," she said; "for
I am not the woman to come grovelling to a man for
pardon, because I once dared to tell him the truth to his
face."
</p>

<p>
Without another word Paul turned on his heel and
left her, and never once looked back.  As he strode out
of Kensington Gardens he felt that to him in future the
place would be a cemetery rather than a garden, for
there he had buried the one love of his life.
</p>

<p>
So Paul and Isabel passed out of each other's ken,
simply because the latter had been fool enough to think
that a good man's love was a thing to be played with,
rather than a gift for which to "thank heaven, fasting".
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that the troubles sent by Providence
are always beneficial if taken in a proper spirit;
but the troubles brought on by our own or another's
ill-doing are not necessarily salutary at all.  Therefore both
Paul and Isabel were the worse for their separation.
</p>

<p>
Paul threw himself heart and soul into his work, and
turned his back upon all the amenities of life.  He had
lost his faith in love and in his old ideals, and the loss
was not good for him; he became morose and hard and
cynical, and inclined to sneer at higher things.  His love
for Isabel had been so bound up with all that was best
in him, that when Isabel failed, much of his best went
with her&mdash;at any rate for the time being, till the first
bitterness of the disillusionment was past.
</p>

<p>
As for Isabel, she put on a brave face before the world,
and spent her days in laughter and her nights in tears.
While Paul hid his misery under a mask of stern moroseness,
she concealed hers under an affectation of frivolity.
She had never seemed so gay or so heartless or so
worldly; and, after a while, her imagination almost
persuaded her that she cared as little as she pretended to
care.  She never allowed herself time to think, and she
nearly succeeded in believing that she was really
forgetting Paul; nevertheless she grew thinner and paler,
and there was a wan look underneath her restless
brilliancy that Lady Farley did not care to see.
</p>

<p>
Isabel never had any news of Paul; he had completely
passed out of her life.  But Paul managed to
glean tidings of Isabel; and the news that she was more
amusing and more admired than ever did not in any way
lessen his misery.
</p>

<p>
Paul wrote a curt letter to his own people saying
that Isabel had broken off the engagement, but giving no
reason; and he begged that her name might never again
be mentioned in his hearing.  The minister was sorry,
but felt that it was according to the decree of Providence;
Mrs. Seaton was grieved, but feared that it was
owing to the pride of Paul; and Joanna was angry, and
felt sure that it was because of the vanity of Isabel.  All
of which suppositions were not without a foundation of
truth.
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley tried hard not to be glad that the
engagement was broken off; but she only succeeded in
hiding her gladness from her niece.  And she comforted
Isabel&mdash;according to her lights&mdash;by taking her
into society more untiringly than ever.
</p>

<p>
One night, towards the end of the season, there was
a party at the Marchioness of Wallingford's; and Isabel
was, as usual, surrounded by a small court of men.  She
was looking particularly well in a yellow gown, which
suited her dark hair to perfection.  Mr. Madderley, on
learning from her in the Row that morning that yellow
was to be her "only wear" at this party, had sent her
a spray of yellow roses.  But Isabel hated yellow roses;
she had worn one in her belt the day that Paul made
her go for a walk with him, and therefore&mdash;like Ben
Jonson's "rosy wreath"&mdash;such flowers thenceforward
smelt not of themselves but Paul.  So she threw away
the artist's gift, and would not touch it again.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you will shortly be going down to Elton
Manor, Miss Carnaby, and thereby turning London into
a desert," said Lord Wrexham.
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Isabel.  "I am not going to Elton, but
to Homburg instead.  I am getting too old for the
country, do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot allow that," remonstrated his lordship.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am.  I consider the country is only suited
to people who are young enough to go in for picnics
and ideals and things of that kind.  Up to five-and-twenty,
sunsets excite your highest emotions, and make
you yearn after the impossible; after five-and-twenty,
they give you rheumatism and show up your wrinkles."
</p>

<p>
"I like the country," remarked Lord Robert Thistletown,
"though I am at last in the proud position of being
able to deny the soft impeachment of being under
five-and-twenty; it always makes me feel good, and fills me
with the desire to sing hymns and to write to my mother."
</p>

<p>
"I also like the country," murmured Mr. Madderley;
"it gives me a peaceful, lotus-eating kind of feeling, which
is most soothing."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I could stand a land where
it was always afternoon, but what I cannot endure is
a land where it is always Sunday evening."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you liked Sunday evenings and things of
that kind," remarked Lord Robert.
</p>

<p>
"I used to, but I have outgrown them," replied Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Dear lady, I understand," sighed Mr. Madderley.
"I never cared for Sunday evenings myself, but I used
to adore Holman Hunt.  It is the same kind of
sentiment, and indicates the state of mind which would
revel in Wordsworth's 'Ode on the Intimations of
Immortality'."
</p>

<p>
"Have you outgrown it too?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not outgrown my appreciation of the art
and the poetry thus embodied; but I have ceased to
have any feeling excited thereby save admiration."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the real explanation is that as we grow
older we lose in imagination what we gain in experience,"
said Lord Wrexham.
</p>

<p>
Isabel shrugged her shoulders.  "I think it rather
lies in the fact that in drinking the draught of life we
soon get through the white froth on the top and come
to the small beer underneath."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I like Sunday evenings and hymns and things
in that line," persisted Lord Bobby.  "I even go to the
length of liking Christmas Day."
</p>

<p>
"A man who can like Christmas Day will drink sweet
champagne and enjoy it," remarked Madderley.
</p>

<p>
Lord Bobby shook his head.  "Oh!  I won't go that far."
</p>

<p>
"Now I, on the contrary," said Isabel, "cannot bear
Christmas Day; it is neither one thing nor another."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is," argued Lord Bobby.  "It is both; it is
a delicious compound of Sunday morning and Saturday
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Just so," replied Isabel, "it wears a silk blouse
with a serge skirt, and so is neither Sunday nor
week-day.  Now, sweet champagne I do like; and if people
give their guests dry champagne, I think sugar and cream
ought to be handed round with it, as they are with tea.
But Christmas Day is another thing.  To the young it
brings unqualified bliss, I admit; but to the mature it
brings passive depression followed by active indigestion."
</p>

<p>
"But you used to be awfully keen on goodness and
all that sort of thing," objected Lord Robert.  "I never
met such a girl for ideals as you were at one time."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Bobby, I was once awfully keen on dolls
and blind man's buff.  As I told you, I am growing old."
</p>

<p>
Lord Robert looked puzzled and disappointed.  "But
you still believe in good people, don't you, Miss
Carnaby?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; but they bore me.  I believe in quinine as
a drug, but I think it is very nasty as a flavour."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham smiled indulgently.  "The fact is that
you have such a gay and sunny nature yourself that too
much seriousness oppresses you and overpowers you.
Ethereal beings cannot exist in a heavy atmosphere."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot endure the sort of good people who have
their biographies written," exclaimed Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, biography is the style of fiction I most
affect," said Mr. Madderley, "especially the biographies
of people I have met.  It is so interesting to learn that
what one had despised as dulness was in reality genius;
and that what one had regretted as rudeness was in reality
the scorn of a great soul for conventions."
</p>

<p>
"While what one condemned as bad temper was
actually a noble struggle against evil," added Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"A saint in crape is twice a saint in print," murmured
the artist.
</p>

<p>
"You shall write our biographies, Mr. Madderley, and
show how I was wise, Lord Bobby was profound, and
Lord Wrexham was&mdash;I don't know what Lord Wrexham
had better be."
</p>

<p>
"Amusing, perhaps," suggested his lordship quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see you with a really serious-minded
man, and hear how you got on with him," said Mr. Madderley.
"I mean one of the sort of men who go in for
duties and responsibilities and queer fads of that sort,
and always keep a tame conscience in full work on the
premises."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it funny," remarked Isabel thoughtfully, "that
if a woman talks to a man about his soul, other women
call her a saint; while if she talks to him about his heart,
they call her a flirt?  They have not the sense to know
that the flirtiness consists in talking to the man about
himself at all."
</p>

<p>
All the men laughed.
</p>

<p>
"There is really nothing to talk about but ourselves,"
continued Isabel, "just as there is really nothing for
breakfast but bacon.  People try all sorts of fancy
subjects and dishes, but they come back to where they
started from, like boomerangs."
</p>

<p>
"You are a very clever young lady," said Lord Wrexham
appreciatively.  "You combine such keen powers
of perception with such a great facility of expression."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  I have devoted a considerable time to
'the proper study of mankind,' and I consider myself a
proficient in the subject."
</p>

<p>
"It is a subject which repays careful study, my dear
lady," remarked Madderley.  "I know only one that excels
it in interest, and that one&mdash;being composed entirely of
brilliant exceptions ungoverned by any guiding rules&mdash;I
should describe as a dangerous recreation rather than as
a proper study."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you understand men as well as you
think you do," exclaimed Lord Bobby bluntly.
</p>

<p>
Isabel raised her pretty eyebrows.  "Don't I, though?"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Thistletown," said Mr. Madderley;
"you are surely mistaken.  Miss Carnaby's knowledge
of this subject is experimental as well as profound, and
her treatment of it is beyond&mdash;sometimes considerably
beyond&mdash;all praise."
</p>

<p>
An angry spot burned on Isabel's cheek.  "You are
pleased to be very witty this evening, Mr. Madderley."
</p>

<p>
"Once upon a time," added the artist, "there was a
rose who imagined she knew how to make beeswax,
because there were always some bees buzzing round her.
It amused the bees."
</p>

<p>
"And what was the end of the story?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"The end, dear lady?  There is but one end to all
stories.  The rose faded."

CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
Angus Grey.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  He proved that Hope was all a lie,<br>
  And Faith a form of bigotry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love a snare that caught him;<br>
  Then thought to comfort human tears<br>
  By sundry ill-considered sneers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At things his mother taught him.<br>
</p>

<p>
Early in the year following Isabel's cruel
treatment of Paul, a novel was published which
made some little stir.  It was called <i>Shams
and Shadows</i>, and was by an unknown author,
Angus Grey.
</p>

<p>
It was not what is generally known as a bad book;
yet, nevertheless, it was very far from being good.  Its
cleverness was undeniable; but, on the other hand, its
style was flippant, its teaching mischievous, and its
philosophy cynical in the extreme.  The aim of the book was
to prove that the fashionable world is rotten at the
core, and that the religious world is no better; and
that in all Churches and sects there are little
side-chapels dedicated to Mammon, where the majority of
the worshippers are to be found.
</p>

<p>
Angus Grey was apparently a man who had eaten of
apples of Sodom, and had found them turn to ashes in
his mouth; and he was anxious to share his meal with
the rest of mankind, and to exclude no one from
partaking of his bitter hospitality.  Evidently he was a
disappointed man, and his disappointment had not
improved him.  With a crude and cheap cynicism, he set
forth that the ideals of youth are a dream, and the
professions of later life a delusion; and he sneered alike
at the follies of the young and the pretences of the
middle-aged.
</p>

<p>
To Angus Grey there was nothing sacred, nothing
holy; and he pointed his morals and adorned his tale
with caricatures of personages well known in society.
</p>

<p>
To the initiated, some of the characters in <i>Shams
and Shadows</i> were portraits but thinly disguised.  It
was easy to recognize Lord Wrexham, Bobby Thistletown,
and Mr. Madderley; but the best drawn character
in the book was the heroine, who was the counterfeit
presentment of Isabel Carnaby; yet not Isabel as she
really was, and as Nature had meant her to be; but
Isabel as she appeared to outward seeming, when the
worldly and frivolous side of her character was
upper-most.  She had all Isabel's fun and sparkle and
good-humour; but underneath them lay a cold and shallow
selfishness, which disgusted the readers she had at first
charmed.
</p>

<p>
At first everybody was asking who Angus Grey could
be, as it was evident that he was some one well versed
in the ways of this particular set; but gradually it was
whispered about that the author of <i></i>Shams and Shadows<i></i>
was "that young Seaton whom Isabel Carnaby threw
over last season".  Lady Farley was not surprised to
hear this; she had long suspected it; but she took it
upon herself to break the news to Isabel, as she did
not know how her niece would take it.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," she said to Isabel one day, "it has
come out at last who Angus Grey really is; it is the <i>nom
de plume</i> of Paul Seaton."
</p>

<p>
Isabel started up, her face very white.  "Who told
you so?  It isn't true.  I won't believe it!"
</p>

<p>
"But you must believe it, my dear.  It is an open
secret.  Everybody knows."
</p>

<p>
"How can people be so unjust?  Paul would never
have written a horrid book like that; I know him too
well to believe such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"I grant you that it is not a nice book," said Lady
Farley, "nor one that a gentleman would have written.
But that he did write it, there is no doubt; for Bobby
Thistletown met him and asked him straight out if he
had adopted the name of Angus Grey, and Mr. Seaton
confessed that he had.  You know how Bobby goes
straight to the point, and how there is no hoodwinking
him when he wants to find out anything."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked dumfounded.  "Do you mean that
Paul actually told Bobby that he was Angus Grey?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you exactly what Bobby told me, so, you
see, I come straight from head-quarters."
</p>

<p>
"What else did Bobby say to Paul?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he congratulated him on the success of his
book, and Mr. Seaton thanked him and said it had already
had a great sale.  But the fact is that Bobby was so
disgusted with the personal tone of the book that he did not
care to be on friendly terms with the author, so he cut
the conversation somewhat short."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think it is such a horrid book, Aunt Caroline?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't an improving book&mdash;no one pretends that it
is; but it is very smart.  And I cannot see that you, of
all people, have any right to blame Paul Seaton for
writing it.  If it amuses you to break men's hearts, my
dear, by all means do it; but do not cry out if the smash
makes more dust and noise than you expected.  Breakages
are often noisy, from tea-things upwards."
</p>

<p>
"But Paul never was flippant or cynical," persisted
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he was not till you made him so.  As
you know, I never liked Paul Seaton; but I am a just
woman, and in this matter I cannot help saying that I
consider you are more culpable than he.  I am not
blaming you, my dear child, for I should probably have
done the same thing at your age; but if you have your
fling you must be content to pay the bill."
</p>

<p>
Isabel sighed, and her aunt continued: "You deliberately
broke the young man's heart and destroyed all his
ideals; yet you are surprised when, in return, he tries
to prove to the world that love is a fable and idealism a
folly.  It is simply the natural outcome of your action."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Aunt Caroline, what shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  There is nothing to be done; it would
have been more dignified, perhaps, had the man not cried
out when he was hurt; still it is very human to cry out
when our pain seems more than we can endure, and I
feel I cannot blame him much.  If any one had treated
me as you have treated Paul Seaton, I think it is in me
to write quite as bitter a book as <i>Shams and Shadows</i>,
and probably I should have done so."
</p>

<p>
"But Paul was different."
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley smiled.  "Different from me, you mean!
My dear, you must remember that he was your lover and
I am only your aunt, and you look at us through
differently tinted spectacles.  But human nature is pretty
much the same in everybody, and when human nature is
hit too hard, human nature hits back, either at its fellows,
or at Providence, or at both.  I admit that it was
somewhat ill-bred of Mr. Seaton to abuse our hospitality by
making 'copy' of our faults.  Still if you objected to
seeing the real nature of the Tartar, you should not have
scratched the Russian so hard.  Disappointment shows
what stuff men are made of."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it does," Isabel acquiesced.
</p>

<p>
"There is no doubt, my dear Isabel, that you behaved
very badly to Paul Seaton; and it was a natural enough
revenge, I think, to show to the world&mdash;in the person of
his heroine&mdash;how heartless a fashionable woman can be.
I really cannot see that you have any just ground for
complaint, though perhaps some others of his characters
have."
</p>

<p>
Then Isabel went to her own room, and cried as if her
heart would break.  She understood, as no one else could,
the subtlety of Paul's revenge; and just at first she felt
that her punishment was almost greater than she could
bear.
</p>

<p>
After the secret of Angus Grey's identity leaked
out, Paul Seaton sent the following letter to the
minister:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"MY DEAR FATHER,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"I should be grieved for you to learn
from any third person that I have adopted the pseudonym of
Angus Grey.  I know that <i>Shams and Shadows</i> is not a book
that you will like&mdash;perhaps I do not like it myself&mdash;but I
would remind you, before you pass judgment upon it, that
people who are sorely disappointed do not preach gospels of
peace and goodwill.  I also wish to tell you that&mdash;however
bitterly I may have been disappointed in other people&mdash;the
reverence I have always felt for your religion and my mother's
will abide with me to my dying day.  Do not let anything that
you may read in the pages of <i>Shams and Shadows</i> ever lead
you to doubt this.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your affectionate son,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PAUL SEATON."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton cried over <i>Shams and Shadows</i> in secret,
and longed to comfort the sore heart that could have
written such a story; Joanna disapproved of the teaching
of the book, but could not help thinking it clever; and the
minister dealt justly with the matter, and felt that sorrow
was a reason for bitterness but not an excuse.
</p>

<p>
As he and Joanna were going for a long country walk
one Monday afternoon, the latter said: "I am sadly
disappointed that the book Paul has been going to write
all his life has turned out to be such a book as <i>Shams and
Shadows</i>; he ought to have done something so different;
but all the same I do not blame Paul as much as I blame
Isabel.  Though Paul has actually written the book, it
was Isabel's cruelty to him that made him capable of
writing it; for I am certain that she was cruel, though
Paul has never said so."
</p>

<p>
"My child," said Mr. Seaton, "I cannot see that any
unkindness on the part of Isabel can justify Paul's action
in this matter.  No one does wrong without some sort of
temptation or excuse; yet we are none of us tempted above
what we are able to bear, and it is our duty to avail
ourselves of the way of escape provided for us."
</p>

<p>
"But, father, think how our Paul must have changed
before he could write a bitter, cynical book like that!
And I cannot yet forgive the woman who has altered
him so."
</p>

<p>
The minister shook his head.  "A man is not justified
in letting any woman, however dear, come between his
own soul and God.  His happiness may depend upon the
woman he loves, I admit; but his religion should be
independent of her, and of everybody except himself."
</p>

<p>
"But supposing he cannot help it."
</p>

<p>
"He must help it, Joanna; it is a man's first duty to
be religious; a man who is not religious is not a whole man.
He may have a fine literary style and be an accomplished
scholar&mdash;but he is not made in the image of God."
</p>

<p>
"But would you call Paul's book irreligious?" asked
Joanna.
</p>

<p>
Her father thought for a moment.  "I am afraid I
should.  It is not, of course, atheistic or immoral; I do
not mean that; but it is cynical and flippant; and 'he
that is not with Me is against Me'."
</p>

<p>
Joanna sighed.  "It is sometimes difficult to be religious."
</p>

<p>
"It ought not to be.  Religion is not a bill of pains
and penalties, but a charter of happiness.  But,
understand me, I do not condemn Paul's book because it does
not preach any special tenet or uphold any peculiar
creed; for the older I grow the more catholic do I become."
</p>

<p>
"I am not like that," said Joanna, "as I grow older,
the more fondly do I cling to my own 'ism'&mdash;not because
it is an 'ism,' but because it is my own."
</p>

<p>
"You are still a great deal younger than I am.  Our
division lines are far too strong.  The Church began in
catholicity and must end in catholicity, and I would
avoid all peculiar garbs or shibboleths.  Anything which
connects godliness with a grey gown or a close bonnet
is not religion at all, but sectarianism.  Therefore I do
not blame my son for not preaching Methodism; I only
blame him for not preaching Christ."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you love Methodism as much as I do, don't
you, father?"
</p>

<p>
The minister's face glowed.  "Yes, I love it&mdash;of course
I love it; but I do not condemn those who do not love it
as I do.  As long as there are different types of character,
there must be different forms of worship; yet nothing
appeals to me like the good old Methodist fashion of
bringing religion into the common experiences of everyday
life, and treating it as a familiar thing.  To a Ritualist
this might seem irreverent; to a Broad Churchman,
oppressive; but I always feel it may be said of the
Methodists, as of the Israelites of old, 'They did eat and
drink, and saw God'."
</p>

<p>
"The thing that grieves me in Paul's book is its want
of idealism and its disbelief in the underlying goodness of
human nature," remarked Joanna, as they turned into
Chayford Wood.
</p>

<p>
"I do not agree with you there.  Human nature,
apart from God, is not a fine thing, and I have no
sympathy whatever in the modern worship of Humanity with
a capital H.  Human nature is our disease&mdash;Christ is
our cure; and a physician who diagnoses any complaint
without suggesting the remedy, may be an able scientist,
but he is a sorry doctor.  I cannot quarrel with Paul for
showing us that human nature is bad; but I do quarrel
with him for trying to show us that religion is not much
better."
</p>

<p>
"Still we must do Paul justice," said Joanna loyally;
"and one cannot deny that <i>Shams and Shadows</i> is a
brilliantly clever book."
</p>

<p>
"So be it; yet it is character&mdash;not intellect&mdash;that
governs this world and inherits the next."
</p>

<p>
"Yet, father, if Paul were really in such dreadful
trouble and bitterness of spirit, he could not write a book
and keep himself, and therefore his sorrow, out of it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," replied Mr. Seaton, "then why write
a book at all?  Our fathers doubtless sorrowed as we
sorrow now, yet they locked their grief up in their own
breasts, while we proclaim it on the housetops.  I cannot
approve the modern custom of telling out all we know
and feel."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think people ought to write books?"
asked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Not unless they have a message to deliver; and,
moreover, a message which will make for good and not
for evil.  Now every boy who learns a lesson or loves a
woman must needs write a book about it, till we feel
inclined to ask, like the Egyptian of old: 'Who made
thee a ruler and a judge over us?'"
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true!"
</p>

<p>
"People are too anxious to make a stir in the world,"
continued her father, "the doctrine of to-day is that it is
disgraceful to be unknown.  The souls of modern men
need all their wings to enable them to fly as quickly as
their fellows, and they have none left wherewith to cover
their faces and their feet."
</p>

<p>
"But, father, it is natural for men to long for fame."
</p>

<p>
"Natural, doubtless, my child, but not spiritual.  Why
will not men be content to love Christ and live contentedly
as failures, remembering that&mdash;humanly speaking&mdash;His
religion is a failure in the world to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Still people have to make a living," argued Joanna
the practical, "and if they can do it better by writing
books than in any other way, I do not see why they
shouldn't."
</p>

<p>
"If making a living be all we think of, we had better
have been cows or horses," said Mr. Seaton, "in the
present day, money and amusement are the only things
people really care about, and poor things they are
wherewith to satisfy immortal souls.  But a writer is
in a measure a preacher, and takes responsibilities upon
himself towards others which he is bound to fulfil."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father dear, I see what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Every writer is an evangelist of some sort.  Homer
preached the gospel of war, and Virgil taught the ancients
the blessedness of a peasant's lot; Horace pointed out
the inherent meanness of human nature, and in Milton's
hands we may say of the epic, as of the sonnet, that 'the
thing became a trumpet' to proclaim the religious tenets
of the Puritans.  And I would rather that my son had
followed in the steps of Virgil or of Milton than of
Homer or Horace."
</p>

<p>
And then Mr. Seaton went on to expound to his
daughter the messages and the methods of the ancient
schools of poetry, and let Paul and his doings alone.
</p>

<p>
Not long after this, Paul Seaton came home for a
short visit; but his holiday did not prove a success.
His family carefully refrained from saying anything
derogatory of <i>Shams and Shadows</i>; but Paul was so
much afraid of their doing so that he was on the
defensive all the time, and consequently decidedly
disagreeable.  Moreover, he was still very unhappy, and
unhappiness does not tend to social charm.  He appreciated
his parents' forbearance about <i>Shams and Shadows</i>
more than they had any idea of; but, as yet, he was too
sore and too deeply wounded to be able to say pleasant
things to anybody; therefore he unjustly got the credit
of not feeling them.  Altogether life was passing but
roughly for Paul at that particular time.
</p>

<p>
Just before he went back to town, Edgar said to him:
"You won't be vexed with me, will you, old fellow, if I
speak to you as a friend about matters which do not
concern me?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it?" asked Paul ungraciously.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to write another book to counteract the
influence of <i>Shams and Shadows</i>.  No one understands
better than I do the feelings which influenced you when
you wrote it; but feelings pass away, and a man is not
always the same man.  The talent displayed in the pages
of your book might have a decided influence for good if
used in a right direction; and I want you so to use it,
and to rise to higher things on the stepping-stone of the
dead self that wrote <i>Shams and Shadows</i>."
</p>

<p>
Paul smoked in silence, and Edgar went on: "And
there is another argument I would use, if I were sure you
would forgive me for using it, and not think me interfering
or impertinent."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Paul, "it is all right.".
</p>

<p>
"You see," said Edgar, "if we do anything as the
result of a state of mind which has been brought on by
the action of another person, that person is, in a measure,
responsible for our action."
</p>

<p>
Paul nodded, and Edgar continued: "If we had ever
loved that person, I do not think we should like to feel
that they&mdash;through us&mdash;had wrought lasting evil; this
conviction would be a source of endless remorse to us,
for the old love's sake, even long after that love was a
thing of the past.  We might be content to bear the
consequences of our own share of ill-doing; but we could
not endure the idea that we ourselves had increased the
responsibility of any one who had once been dear to us,
however thoroughly they might have forfeited our affection.
I won't say any more, old man; it is very good of
you to have listened to me so far; and I think you will
understand what I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Look here," replied Paul, "you have spoken very
kindly to me, and I appreciate what you have said and,
perhaps still more, what you have left unsaid; and I will
confess to you what I have confessed to no other living
soul, namely, that I regret with all my heart that <i>Shams
and Shadows</i> was ever written.  I would gladly give
twenty years of my life to unwrite it if I could; but that,
unfortunately, is impossible."
</p>

<p>
"You cannot unwrite it, I know," said Edgar, "but
you can write a new book that will prove its antidote;
and, by your new book's superior depth and power, you
can make men forget that <i>Shams and Shadows</i> was ever
written."  And he laid a brotherly hand on his friend's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Paul rose from his chair and stood with one elbow on
the chimney-piece.  "That is what I have been intending
to do for some time.  I mean to devote all my powers
to writing a book in my right mind and in my right
name, and I will endeavour to teach men that what is
good is good, and what is bad is bad, which is, after
all, the end of human wisdom.  And people shall see that
the cynicism of <i>Shams and Shadows</i> was the crying of
an unhappy and wayward child rather than the knowledge
and experience of a full-grown man."
</p>

<p>
"What will be the name of the new book?" asked Edgar.
</p>

<p>
Paul thought for a moment.  "I think I shall call it
<i>Some Better Thing</i>," he said.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
Success.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Upon the mountain top I stood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the land beneath me lay;<br>
  I saw that earth was very good,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But heaven seemed just as far away.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was in the following winter that Paul Seaton's
great book, <i>Some Better Thing</i>, took the literary
world by storm, and carried its author at one bound
from mere notoriety to abiding fame.  Everybody
read the book, and everybody who read it was the better
for reading it.  It was a novel with a purpose, and its
purpose was to show that it is only by righteousness that
men and nations prevail; also, that there is much that is
humorous in life as well as much that is holy, and that
healing virtue lies in laughter as well as in prayers and
tears.  It was a strong book, and yet infinitely pathetic;
and it was perfectly free from the taint of shallow
cynicism on the one hand and of mawkish sentimentality on
the other.  Preachers recommended its teaching, and
speakers quoted its epigrams; and, in short, Paul Seaton
became the man of the hour, and Angus Grey was forgotten.
This latter end was the more easily accomplished
because the first edition of <i>Shams and Shadows</i> was sold
out, and another was not forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
<i>Some Better Thing</i> brought great joy to the heart of
Mark Seaton.  That his son was among the successful
writers of the day, was nothing to him; but that his son
was among the great teachers of the day, was everything.
Mrs. Seaton and Joanna likewise rejoiced, and felt that
<i>Shams and Shadows</i> was expiated and done away with.
So happiness reigned once more in Chayford Cottage.
</p>

<p>
As for Paul himself, the success of his book pleased
him to a certain extent; and it was a source of keen
delight to him to feel that men no longer condemned him
as the writer of <i>Shams and Shadows</i>, but rather respected
him as the author of <i>Some Better Thing</i>.  But Isabel had
spoiled his life for him, he felt; and no mere public
applause could fill up the aching blank that she had left.
She had gone near to marring his character as well; but
he had come safely through the dark valley of humiliation
and disappointment, and stood whole and in his right
mind on the farther side.  Yet his happiness had not
survived the chills of the dark valley; and fame without
happiness is but a sorry jest at best.  What matters it
to a thirsty man if his empty cup be of gold or silver or
of finest glass?  Such outside splendours will not slake
his thirst.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless in Paul's mind the thought was ever
present that Isabel Carnaby would see <i>Some Better Thing</i>,
and would read as much, perhaps, between the lines as the
public could read in them.  And&mdash;if the truth must be
told&mdash;this thought gave him more pleasure than all his literary
triumph; for, in spite of what had happened, his love for
Isabel was as strong as ever, and his hope was not yet
dead that some day they two might be brought together
again and might bid bygones be bygones.  Paul knew
that the ideal Isabel whom he had loved was no creature
of his own imagination, but the real Isabel as God had
intended her to be; he had merely recognized&mdash;not
imagined&mdash;the soul of the woman hidden under her somewhat
frivolous exterior.  He believed that this soul was
not extinct, but merely dormant for a time, and he knew
that he was the only man who had power to awaken it
fully to life again.  There was no doubt that Isabel had
been cruel as well as wilful; but perhaps he had been too
hard and stern for so highly strung a nature as hers; and
to those that love much, surely much can be forgiven.
Anyhow Isabel had not committed the one crowning
offence in his eyes&mdash;she had not put another man in his
place&mdash;and as long as she was still Miss Carnaby, Paul
felt there was yet a possible morning of joy to his present
night of weeping.
</p>

<p>
Early in the year Paul went down to Chayford, and
was welcomed as a conquering hero.  The family at the
Cottage were never tired of talking about <i>Some Better
Thing</i>; but <i>Shams and Shadows</i> was only once alluded
to, and then by Paul himself.
</p>

<p>
"Father, do you think that <i>Shams and Shadows</i> is
now atoned for?" he asked one day.
</p>

<p>
"My son, we will never speak of <i>Shams and Shadows</i>
more.  Do you think that when the angel led Peter out
of prison they talked of the denial; or when Moses stood
on the Mount of Transfiguration he was reminded of his
disobedience at Meribah?  The teaching of modern philosophy
is that what is done is done, and what we have written
we have written; and that there is no atonement for the
deed once accomplished, and no washing out of the
handwriting against us.  But I have not so learned Christ."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you believe that what is done can ever be
undone?" asked Paul.  "Surely that is impossible."
</p>

<p>
"I do not wish to prophesy smooth things," replied
his father, "nor to sprinkle the way of life with
rose-water.  I know that if a man breaks the laws of
Nature he will be punished to the uttermost, for there is
no forgiveness in Nature.  I know that if a man breaks
the laws of Society he will find neither remission nor
mercy, for there is no forgiveness in Society; but I
believe that if a man breaks the law of God his transgression
can be taken away as though it had never been, for
'there is forgiveness with Thee that Thou mayest be
feared'."
</p>

<p>
"It is a grand gospel that you preach, father, and
seems almost too good to be true."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is too good to be true; the truth is the best
of everything."
</p>

<p>
"I believe that," said Paul, "but I did not always."
</p>

<p>
"Before you were afflicted you went astray," answered
the minister, "but the word is very nigh you now."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so."
</p>

<p>
"The modern gospel of the grandeur of human nature
is a hard one," said Mr. Seaton, "and tends rather to
exalt the creature than to glorify the Creator.  If the
great object of life is the formation of our own character,
then, I grant you, each action must leave its indelible
mark; but if the great object of life is the glory of
God, then, surely, the mistakes of foolish men will not
be allowed to cast lasting shadows across the eternal
Light."
</p>

<p>
"You think our ideas are too small."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and too personal.  The business of our lives is
to give glory to God; and it is of no moment whether we
do it by sounding His praises abroad or by keeping His
commandments at home.  It seems to me that now-a-days
men think and talk too much about improving their
own characters, and meditate too little upon the
perfection of the Divine Character."
</p>

<p>
"They ought to do the one without leaving the other
undone," said Paul.  "I cannot admit that holiness is a
substitute for usefulness."
</p>

<p>
"You and I travel by different roads and our methods
are not alike; yet both our ways lead up to Jerusalem,
as all roads lead to Rome."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Paul, "the railways are not laid along
the old coachroads, but they bring us to the same places
as the coaches did."
</p>

<p>
"And more quickly, too," added Mr. Seaton.  "I
must not forget that."
</p>

<p>
During his stay at Chayford, Paul saw a great deal of
Mr. Ford.  These two shared many opinions, both political
and otherwise, and much enjoyed mutual intercourse.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you could knock some of your common-sense
into Edgar," said Edgar's father one day, "it would be
invaluable to him in his political career."
</p>

<p>
"The inculcation of common-sense is a complicated
operation," replied Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I know it," sighed Michael Ford.
</p>

<p>
"Does Edgar intend to go into Parliament soon?"
Paul asked, as he and Mr. Ford walked down the High
Street together.
</p>

<p>
"I mean him to stand for Chayford at the next election.
The sitting member, Halkin, has decided to retire
after the present Parliament, and the Liberal executive
of Chayford have resolved to accept Edgar in his place as
their candidate."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it will be a walk-over for Edgar."
</p>

<p>
"Practically so.  Chayford has always returned a
Liberal, and a Liberal of the good old school&mdash;none of
your new-fangled faddists.  Besides, Edgar would be sure
of the Wesleyan vote solid; no Wesleyan, however
Conservative, would vote against one of the Fords of
Chayford."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true; the Wesleyans are a wonderful
people for pulling together."
</p>

<p>
"What I am afraid of," continued Mr. Ford, "is that
Edgar will go in for somewhat extreme measures, instead
of jogging along on the good old beaten track.  I suppose
he would be sure of the seat even if his views were
decidedly advanced; but I had rather he had adopted the
political creed which satisfied his fathers before him."
</p>

<p>
"Still our fathers' creeds and our fathers' faiths do
not always fit us, Mr. Ford; and I do not believe in
equipping ourselves for the battle of life with second-hand
weapons and armour, even though they be inherited
from our parents.  What should you think of a soldier
who went to War to-day in the coat of mail worn by his
ancestors during the Crusades; or was content to arm
himself for the fray with a musket that did good service
at Waterloo?"
</p>

<p>
"I should call him a picturesque fool."
</p>

<p>
"So should I; I think that it is every man's duty
to keep abreast of the time," continued Paul, "whether
he be a doctor or a politician.  You would not consider a
doctor was breaking the fifth commandment because he
refused to cure fever by cupping, or smallpox by
inoculation; then why should you bring this charge against the
politician who has outgrown the Liberalism of the Whigs?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford shook his head.  "You young men always
think you know better than the old ones."
</p>

<p>
"We don't really know better; we only know what is
better for us and for our generation.  Politicians are
'the faculty' of the State, and it is their business&mdash;as it
is the doctors' business&mdash;to prescribe for the diseases of
to-day and not for the diseases of the past century.  The
medicines which cured the latter will probably have no
effect upon the former."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that each generation has its own difficulties
to contend with, and must therefore use its own
special methods.  There is a good deal in what you say,
I must admit."
</p>

<p>
"Where I disapprove of modern philosophy," continued
Paul, "is when it begins to sneer at the teaching
of former schools.  My argument cuts both ways; if
we know our own business better than our fathers,
they knew their business better than we do.  Each
generation understands what is best for itself; and
it is just as foolish for us to deride our fathers' methods,
as for them to despise ours.  Their ways were the ways
for yesterday, as ours are the ways for to-day; and the
transference of either would be an anachronism."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford nodded.  "I see; and I am almost tempted
to agree with you."
</p>

<p>
"But besides the unwisdom of laughing at our fathers'
methods, it seems to me such atrociously bad form.  If
a young man adopts verbatim either the religious or the
political creed of his father, I probably shall not agree
with him, but I shall respect him as an honourable man,
who is just as likely to be right as I am; but if a man
sneers at and is ashamed of the things which his father
cherished and believed in, I regard that man as a cad
and should decline to ask him to dinner."
</p>

<p>
"There you are quite right; I cannot bear to hear
young folks jeering at the old faiths."
</p>

<p>
"But the worst is when they do it for social reasons,
and not from any honest conviction," Paul went on;
"it makes me perfectly ill to see men treat their parents
as family secrets, because the good old folks do not
happen to vote on the side of the aristocracy, or
worship according to established form."
</p>

<p>
"They have an idea that in burying the ancestral
Radicalism and Nonconformity out of sight, they thereby
identify themselves with the high-born and orthodox."
</p>

<p>
"I know they do; just as some men think that to
walk up to their business in a pair of riding-breeches,
places them socially on a level with a master of
hounds."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford enjoyed this joke: he rode to hounds himself,
and was a good horseman.  "And they forget that
cutting oneself off from one's own class does not attach
one to a higher class; it merely leaves one without a
class at all," he concluded.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," agreed Paul, "between heaven and earth,
like Mahomet's coffin.  I don't of course deny that it is
a good thing to be well-born and wealthy.  I only say
that it is a bad thing to pretend to be so when you are
not.  I don't deny that it is a good thing to be handsome;
but a man had better have a snub nose of his own than
an artificial aquiline."
</p>

<p>
"That is perfectly true."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot blame people for seeing the humorous
side of much that their parents considered wholly serious,"
added Paul, "nor for laughing&mdash;tenderly and among
themselves&mdash;at old-fashioned forms which they have
outgrown; but laughing tenderly and sneering are two very
different things.  For instance, a man who now-a-days
could read such books as <i>The Fairchild Family</i> and
<i>Stories from the Church Catechism</i> without a smile, would
be lacking in a sense of humour; but a man who sneered
at the underlying godliness thus quaintly embodied, would
be deficient in true reverence and spiritual insight."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so."
</p>

<p>
"Besides, I cannot understand the indifference to
the charm of old association which would permit a man
to regard with anything but tenderness the faith in which
he was brought up, however far he might leave it behind
in his maturer years.  For instance, nothing would induce
me to wear boots with elastic-sides; I think they are
extremely uncomfortable and unhealthy and unbecoming;
nevertheless, I never catch sight of those worn by my
mother without being conscious of a wave of tender
amusement; and for her sake all women who walk
through life in elastic-sided boots are in a measure
sacred to me."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford smiled, as he looked at the well-dressed man
walking by his side.  "Yet you yourself would not buy a
pair of boots unless they had patent fasteners and cork
soles, and every other invention of modern times."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I should not: which things are an allegory."
</p>

<p>
"Eh, dear!" sighed Mr. Ford, "I wish I had a son
like you.  What a political future I would have mapped
out for him!"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I am a person who does not lend himself
to mapping-out.  I should like to go into political life,
I confess; but I fear my politics would not always be
your politics, Mr. Ford."
</p>

<p>
"I think they would, in great issues, and we would
leave the trifles to take care of themselves.  We are both
opportunists, Paul; the only difference between us is the
difference between the opportunities of thirty years ago
and the opportunities of to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I think you have hit the nail on the head."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go in for political life yourself?"
asked Michael Ford abruptly, quickening his pace.
</p>

<p>
"Because I can't afford it.  I am a poor man, and all
my people are poor.  I make a fair income by editing
<i>The Pendulum</i> and writing anonymous articles for a good
many of the dailies, but not an income that would allow
of anything like a parliamentary career."
</p>

<p>
"But <i>Shams and Shadows</i> and <i>Some Better Thing</i>
must have brought you in a good deal."
</p>

<p>
"I have not yet received my royalties on <i>Some Better
Thing</i>, and I could not touch a penny of the profits of
<i>Shams and Shadows</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Now, there, my dear boy, you are wrong, and you
must forgive an old friend for telling you so.  That <i>Shams
and Shadows</i> was a false step, I admit; and I am very
glad that you have so soon retrieved it by contradicting
all its nonsense in <i>Some Better Thing</i>; but I consider it
a piece of idiotic quixotism to refuse the money that
<i>Shams and Shadows</i> made."
</p>

<p>
"I think you must please let me be the judge of
that," said Paul quietly.
</p>

<p>
"But, my good fellow, you are making a mistake, and
are acting more like Edgar than like yourself.  Throwing
away the money which you fairly earned by your very
clever if somewhat foolish book, is a piece of gratuitous
self-denial which will do no good to anybody."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled the smile of the obstinate, and Mr. Ford
continued:
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is extremely silly of you.  Now you were
right not to publish a second edition of your
book&mdash;although such an edition might have been of pecuniary
advantage to you&mdash;because you saw that the book was
unsound, and you had ceased to believe in your former
teaching.  For this I admire and respect you.  But I
cannot see why you should hesitate to appropriate the
proceeds of the copies already sold."
</p>

<p>
Paul walked on in silence for a few seconds; then he
said: "I simply could not do it, and that is the end of it".
</p>

<p>
"I could have believed Edgar capable of such a piece
of folly, but not you," grumbled Mr. Ford.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to make myself disagreeable, but I fear I
am one of the self-opinionated people who think they
know their own business best."
</p>

<p>
"And I suppose you won't tell me what you mean to
do with the sacrificial proceeds of your first book.  You
cannot leave them with the publishers.  I don't know
what your royalty on <i>Shams and Shadows</i> was; but,
however small, you must do something with it."  Mr. Ford
spoke with irritation, for he was a man of business.
</p>

<p>
"You think I am bound to accept the minor profits,
you mean.  My father has a great sermon on that
subject&mdash;but he spells it 'with a difference'."
</p>

<p>
"A poor joke is no substitute for a plain answer,
Paul."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember the lady who was afraid she had
asked an indiscreet question of Talleyrand, and was told
that a question is never indiscreet but an answer may
be?"
</p>

<p>
"You have not yet outgrown your quixotism, I see,
my dear boy."
</p>

<p>
"Not I; and I happen to be suffering from a pretty
sharp attack of it just now, brought on, I suppose, by fine
weather and flattery judiciously blended.  So you must
bear with my youthful follies."
</p>

<p>
"I could bear with a great deal from such a clever
man as that," said Mr. Ford to himself, after he had
parted from Paul.  "He'll make a name in the world
which men will remember; and that Carnaby girl was
a fool to throw up her chance of bearing it!"
</p>

<p>
So gradually peace&mdash;and something akin to happiness&mdash;"slid
into the soul" of Paul Seaton.  In spite of all
that had happened, he believed that Isabel&mdash;in her heart
of hearts&mdash;really cared for him, and that he was the only
man who could completely satisfy her; and he knew beyond
a doubt that she was the only woman who could ever
satisfy him.  Surely it would all come right in the end,
he thought; it was against every principle of political
economy that so much mutual devotion should be
wasted.
</p>

<p>
To all other women he was utterly indifferent; and
this indifference was so patent to the eyes of Alice Martin
that she soon ceased to wear her best hat when there
was a chance of meeting him.  Best hats, like horses,
require regular air and exercise; and when they are
no longer needed for the driving of one particular
man to distraction, they are not infrequently used to
convey another in the same direction.  Thus it came to pass
that Alice began to put on her best hat when there was a
possibility of seeing (or rather of being seen by) Edgar
Ford.  Of course Edgar did not know what had happened;
he only thought that Alice seemed to grow prettier
every day.  But this is a not uncommon delusion of
Edgar's sex.  They think that a particular girl is growing
decidedly better looking; but it does not always strike
them that the increase of beauty is due to the fact
that this particular girl has begun to put on her best
clothes whenever there is an off-chance of meeting with
them.
</p>

<p>
"Here is something that ought to delight you," said
Mr. Seaton, handing the newspaper to Paul one day.
"The Minister of Education has been delivering an inaugural
address for some literary society, and he has quoted
your new book as the wisest book that has been
published during the last ten years.  He considers that the
political part of it ought to be used as a text-book for
budding politicians; and he foretells a brilliant political
as well as literary career for the author."
</p>

<p>
"Well played, old Willoughby!" exclaimed Paul.  "I
once met him at the Esdailes', and found him a very
decent fellow then; but this proves him to be possessed
of almost supernatural powers of insight and foresight.
Give me the paper and let me read my praise and glory
for myself."
</p>

<p>
"It will make you vain," said Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"You'd be vain if Cabinet Ministers grovelled before
you," retorted her brother.
</p>

<p>
"I know I should.  Nobody ever grovelled before me;
but it would make me vain if an infant did, let alone a
pillar of the State."
</p>

<p>
Paul's face fairly beamed.  "I'm awfully glad that
Willoughby approved of my views on education."
</p>

<p>
"Your next book had better touch on all matters
connected with the State," suggested Joanna; "you might
have a chapter on sanitation, for the President of the
Local Government Board to lecture upon; and a chapter
on commerce, for the President of the Board of Trade to
lecture upon; so that, like freedom, you might 'slowly
broaden down from president to president'."
</p>

<p>
"How rude you are!" exclaimed Paul, "you don't
deserve to have a great author for a brother&mdash;you really
don't.  I take a broad view of the fifth commandment,
and I think that it includes respect to brothers as well as
to parents."
</p>

<p>
Joanna shook her head.  "You are always too broad
in your views; that is your great fault.  The Bible
thoroughly understands human nature, and never commands
the impossible.  Therefore, it tells us to love our
brother, but it never suggests or hints at such a thing as
respect for him."
</p>

<p>
Then she and her father started for a walk, and Paul
sat down to enjoy Mr. Willoughby's lecture, and to dream
over the glorious possibilities that it opened up.  It was a
great compliment, and Paul was the last man to pretend
that he was not delighted when he was.
</p>

<p>
After he had read the report of the lecture, his eye
wandered idly over the rest of the paper till it was
suddenly arrested by the following paragraph:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p style="font-size: 90%">
A marriage is arranged, and will shortly take place, between
Lord Wrexham, and Isabel, only daughter of the late Major
Carnaby, and niece of Sir Benjamin Farley, G.C.B.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
Vernacre Park.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Trim the shrubs and mow the grass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll the alleys shady,<br>
  Make the ways where she will pass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitter for my lady.<br>
</p>

<p>
There was a large house-party at Vernacre Park
at Easter, to meet Miss Carnaby, who had just
become engaged to the host, Lord Wrexham.
Old Lady Wrexham played the part of hostess&mdash;a
most stately and chilly dame, whom Isabel could not
endure; and, in addition to the party from Elton, the
company included the Esdailes, Lord Robert Thistletown
and Mr. Madderley, besides sundry, uneventful
persons, whom nobody took the trouble to differentiate.
</p>

<p>
Isabel had been in a most reckless mood ever since she
accepted Lord Wrexham; she had definitely decided to
stifle the romantic, and to develop the worldly, side of her
character; and&mdash;having made up her mind to permanently
adopt the <i>rÃ´le</i> of a shallow smart woman&mdash;she
almost overdid her part in her anxiety to do herself
injustice.  It certainly was a triumphal procession for
her, this visit to Vernacre as its future mistress; for
Vernacre was one of the finest residences in the Midlands.
</p>

<p>
As they were sitting at lunch on Good Friday, Lady
Esdaile remarked: "Isn't it funny how hungry going to
church always makes one?"
</p>

<p>
"I never have recourse to those artificial aids to
appetite," murmured Madderley.
</p>

<p>
"I'm always ravenous on Sundays," continued Lady
Esdaile, "and my appetite has evidently mistaken to-day
for a Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"A pardonable error," replied the artist, "for my
intellectual powers have fallen into it, too."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad that you are hungry, Lady Esdaile," said
the hostess, "but not surprised, for Vernacre is always
considered a peculiarly invigorating place; the situation is
salubrious, and the subsoil old red sandstone.  I never
feel so well anywhere as I do at Vernacre."
</p>

<p>
"I am always hungry in the country and thirsty in
London," continued Lady Esdaile, "and that is why I
am so much sorrier for poor people in the country than
in town; it must be so horrid to feel hungry and have
nothing to eat, don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"It must indeed," agreed Lord Wrexham; "and I
have often wondered that the health of the lower classes
is not even more seriously impaired than it is, considering
that they must frequently be compelled to leave their
hunger only partially satisfied, if at all."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay they enjoy it," exclaimed Isabel, "I
remember that Aunt Caroline and I were once kept
stuck on a journey for hours, far away from any station,
and we had nothing to eat or drink save a small bottle
of cough-syrup she happened to have in her dressing-bag.
We had to take occasional nips at that; and because it
was scarce we thought it delicious.  I never was addicted
to cough-syrup before, but since then I have preferred it
to champagne."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it was made palatable on purpose,"
suggested Lord Wrexham, "some of those patent medicines
are often far from repulsive to the taste."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  no; it was nasty enough really," replied Isabel;
"but poverty made it sweet.  And I believe poor people
get lots of treats like that."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham shook his head.  "I fear you are right,
and that the poor are too fond of taking quack doses not
recommended by the faculty.  It is a bad habit, but I
presume that economy is their motive."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean that; I only meant that when you
are poor, life must be like one everlasting picnic.  I once
wanted to be poor myself, I thought it would be such
fun."
</p>

<p>
"I once was poor," said Madderley, "and I am
bound to admit that the joke fell short of your
expectations, Miss Carnaby."
</p>

<p>
Isabel helped herself to plovers' eggs.  "I felt I was
foolish at the time, and I prayed for more wisdom."
</p>

<p>
"It is always safe to pray for the inevitable," said the
artist, "it strengthens faith without incommoding Providence."
</p>

<p>
"Having got wisdom, I now pray for the rest of life's
good things, like Solomon&mdash;riches and honours and fine
clothes, and horses and carriages <i>en suite</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I never pray for what I see in the shop-windows,"
said Madderley; "I choose what I think will suit me,
and know that it will be put down in my bill."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's lip curled.  "You are very <i>bourgeois</i> in your
ideas."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so; I am merely honest with myself,
and do not call transactions providential which are merely
commercial.  The temple and the money-changers should
be kept far apart."
</p>

<p>
"I think, Madderley, that you misunderstand Miss
Carnaby," said Lord Wrexham, in his slow, kind way
as he smiled indulgently upon Isabel, "she does not
really mean that she would ask Providence for things with
which her tradesman could supply her."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I shouldn't pray for what I could pay for,"
added Isabel.
</p>

<p>
The artist bowed.  "If I have misunderstood Miss
Carnaby I humbly beg her pardon.  By the way," he
continued, "I once heard a story of a very devout Cornish
wrecker, who never retired to rest, without praying for
a storm.  That always appeals to my sense of humour."
</p>

<p>
"Were his prayers answered?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"There were always plenty of wrecks, if that is what
you mean."
</p>

<p>
"The wreckers were a terrible people," said Lord
Wrexham, "and it was a terrible state of society which
made such things possible."
</p>

<p>
"It is a comfort to think that these customs were
confined to Cornwall and the last century," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Were they?" asked Madderley.
</p>

<p>
"I think so," replied Lord Wrexham, "of course one
has heard of wrecks and salvage on other shores; but I
believe that the custom of deliberately causing wrecks
by means of false lights was peculiar to Cornwall."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you are right," said the artist, "I cannot,
of course, give names or dates, but I have an idea that
I have heard of cases of cruel and avoidable wrecks in
other counties than Cornwall, and considerably later
than the last century."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  I had believed that such savagery was
extinct in England.  I suppose, however, that the love
of gain was the motive now as then?"  And his lordship
looked quite distressed.
</p>

<p>
"And the love of excitement."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, how shocking!"
</p>

<p>
"Such things are shocking," agreed Madderley;
"and doubly shocking to those who have witnessed their
effects."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed a hard little laugh.  "Perhaps Mr. Madderley
will make use of his artistic power to describe
some of these harrowing spectacles."
</p>

<p>
"I shall do nothing of the kind, dear lady; such
descriptions would not be fit for pretty ears.  I believe
even the wreckers themselves would rather not see the
consequences of their cruelty; therefore such things
should be kept from the knowledge of refined and
tender-hearted women, whose nature it is to be kind and
pitiful."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right, Madderley," said Lord Wrexham
approvingly, "descriptions of horrors and cruelties
are most unfit for women's ears, in my opinion."
</p>

<p>
But Isabel still looked defiant.  "Perhaps, then,
Mr. Madderley will tell us where these modern and fiendish
wreckers are to be found."
</p>

<p>
The artist strolled to the sideboard to cut himself some
ham.  "On the sea-coast of Bohemia, and thereabouts."
</p>

<p>
"Don't take any notice of him, Wrexham," said
Isabel petulantly; "he is only making up, just to irritate
me."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham was surprised.  "Why, Isabel, what
is the matter with you?  You and Madderley used to
be such friends."
</p>

<p>
"I know we used; but friendships don't wear for ever,
any more than clothes."
</p>

<p>
"I have always noticed," remarked Madderley,
"that the untried friendships are those which last the
longest."
</p>

<p>
"What is that you are saying about friendships?"
cried Lord Bobby from the other end of the table.  The
place of honour, to which his rank entitled him, was a
grievous burden to this irrepressible youth.  "I can
give you no end of information on the subject, as Platonic
friendship is the line in which I excel."
</p>

<p>
"I do not believe in Platonic friendships," said Lady
Farley, "the woman is all right; but the man always
cares too much or too little for the arrangement to be
a success."
</p>

<p>
"You are wrong," cried Lord Bobby, "I have scores
in good working order just now, so I speak with authority
on the subject.  They are all most successful, and I
start a new one every other week."
</p>

<p>
"Which I suppose you call a neo-Platonic friendship,"
suggested the artist.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so horribly clever," replied Lord Bobby,
"it gives me the headache, and will undermine your
constitution in time."
</p>

<p>
"My experience of Platonic friendships is that they
generally end in the woman's losing her head," remarked
Madderley.
</p>

<p>
"Mine is that they invariably end in the man's losing
his temper," added Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I notice that, as a rule, the man is either bored to
death by the whole thing," said Lady Farley, "or else
overdraws his account on the bank of friendship, and is
surprised when, in consequence, the bank will not cash his
cheques."
</p>

<p>
"That latter case is more often true of the woman
than of the man, I think," replied Madderley.
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley shook her head.  "No; men are much
more exacting than women in their friendships&mdash;that is to
say, if they really care.  It seems to me that men either
care a great deal about things, or not at all; while women
have a regular thermometer of degrees of affection and
interest."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are right there," agreed Lord Wrexham,
"men are so much simpler and less complex than women."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! we are grander altogether," agreed Lord Bobby;
"simpler and yet more sublime, don't you know?  One
cannot help admiring us.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Though on our corns the little spitfires tread,<br>
  Tobacco-smoke unruffled crowns our head."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Everybody laughed, and Lady Farley continued: "I
have studied men carefully for many years, and I feel
that I am now qualified to carry on a satisfactory Platonic
friendship.  But of course, being married, I have not time
or inclination for the thing; soldiers don't run out of a
battle to try their skill at a shooting-range&mdash;they have
heavier work on hand."
</p>

<p>
Sir Benjamin chuckled with delight.  "Still, my dear,
you can give these young and single persons some of the
benefit of your superior wisdom, can't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell us how you would carry on a Platonic friendship,
Aunt Caroline," said Violet Esdaile.
</p>

<p>
"Well, in the first place, I should never argue with a
man; men hate it so, and it does no earthly good.  In my
young days I naturally used to endeavour to prove I was
right when I knew I was; but now, when a man puts me
straight as to facts of which he is absolutely ignorant, I
merely accept his correction, and say I must have been
misinformed.  Of course I know all the time that I am
right and he is wrong, but what does that matter?  It is
a woman's duty to be socially attractive&mdash;not statistically
correct."
</p>

<p>
"And what else should you do, Lady Farley?" asked
her host.
</p>

<p>
"I should never attempt to amend his anecdotes.
This is an unpardonable sin.  I have known homes broken
up and lifelong friendships destroyed, by one person's
saying that a thing happened on Thursday, when the
<i>raconteur</i> had said Friday; while quarrels to which there
could be no reconciliation have ensued from a difference
of opinion as to whether A. met B. by the 10.20 or the
10.45 train."
</p>

<p>
"Lady Farley has studied men to some purpose,"
said Madderley.
</p>

<p>
The lady smiled.  "There is such a thing as
compulsory education."
</p>

<p>
"Caroline is quite right," agreed Lady Esdaile, "it
is never any use arguing with a man.  In the first place
he is always sure to know better than you do."
</p>

<p>
"That was not my reason for objecting to the habit,"
murmured Lady Farley.
</p>

<p>
"But he always is&mdash;that is, if it is anything out of
books or newspapers.  Of course clothes are a different
thing, and there I should be very careful about trusting
a man's taste too far.  At least their taste is right
enough, but they seem to have no proper regard for
fashion."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps now that Aunt Caroline has taught us how
to adapt ourselves to men, Mr. Madderley will teach us
how to adapt ourselves to women," suggested Isabel;
"for I believe he prides himself on his profound
knowledge of, and contempt for, the sex."
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure.  Whenever I am dealing with
ladies I take as my guide and watchword the legend
painted upon the racks of railway carriages: 'These
racks are suited for light articles only, and must not be
used for heavy luggage;' and I find this is a most
successful prescription.  For 'light articles' one must read,
pleasure, luxury, admiration, amusement, etc.; and for
'heavy luggage,' sickness, sorrow, love, poverty, and
every other adversity."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I once knew a man who put his heavy luggage in
the rack, in spite of the printed warning," said the artist,
"and it fell through and broke his head; I knew another
man who made a similar mistake in dealing with a lady;
the consequences were practically the same, only it was
his heart instead of his head that was broken."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes flashed.  "I am afraid your friends are
not as wise as you are."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not; but I am hoping that they will learn
wisdom by experience."
</p>

<p>
"Now where I find men so difficult as friends," said
Isabel, "is that they never will tell you why they are
vexed.  When a man is out of temper there is no secret
about it&mdash;he who runs may read, and she who reads had
better run away; but the reason for this vexation is kept
a profound secret."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right there," agreed Lady Farley;
"it is an interesting but inexplicable fact.  A woman is
different; she will probably not show at all that she is
annoyed, but if she shows it she will tell you the why
and the wherefore."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true; my experience of the sex is
that when they are angry they do not err on the side of
want of frankness," sighed Lord Robert.
</p>

<p>
"And then men are so jealous and exacting,"
continued Isabel, "that is where they disgust me."
</p>

<p>
The artist looked at Isabel curiously, as if by the
outward eye he could discover whether she were as
heartless as she pretended to be; but her appearance
afforded him no clue to the problem.  "A man who
irritates a woman by showing his jealousy, and destroys
her pleasure by such evil tempers, is a fool&mdash;and worse
than a fool," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! not worse than a fool."
</p>

<p>
"You are pleased to be merciful, Miss Carnaby."
</p>

<p>
"Because there is nothing worse," she added.
</p>

<p>
"I quite agree with you," said Madderley, "but
some men seem to regard all things as patent or
copyright, which is manifestly absurd; and men in love are
worse in this respect than Platonic friends."
</p>

<p>
Isabel went on with her lunch while the artist
continued: "If a clergyman or a doctor is not able&mdash;owing
to absence or illness&mdash;to do his work, he supplies a
<i>locum tenens</i> to take his place.  And he is grateful
to&mdash;instead of offended with&mdash;the latter for so doing.  Then
why cannot a lover pursue the same course, and with
the same 'sweet reasonableness,' I want to know?"
</p>

<p>
"The cases hardly seem to me parallel," said Lord
Wrexham, looking puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it doesn't do to press a metaphor too far,"
assented Madderley.
</p>

<p>
"Another absurd thing about men," Isabel went on,
"is that they expect you to like them because they are
kind to you, and do what you want; while what you really
like them for is the trick of their manner or the colour
of their hair."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are in a minority there, my dear Isabel,"
said Lady Farley, "as a rule kindness appeals more
to a woman than anything.  I believe any man could
make any woman love him, if he were only kind enough
long enough."
</p>

<p>
"People like us for what we do, and love us for what
we are," interpolated Sir Benjamin; "that is my experience."
</p>

<p>
"I know," agreed Isabel, "therefore we can make
people like us but we cannot make them love us."
</p>

<p>
"That is true of a woman," said Lady Farley, helping
herself to strawberries, "but hardly of a man.  I
still hold that any man can win a woman's love through
kindness; and I also hold that external roughness of
manner will&mdash;in a woman's eyes&mdash;counteract the effect
of any amount of secret devotion.  When all is said
and done, we like the men who will dance with us
better than the men who would die for us; such is the
constitution of the normal female mind."
</p>

<p>
Isabel tossed her head.  "I do not think so."
</p>

<p>
"But surely you like the people who are kind to you,
don't you?" asked her host.
</p>

<p>
"No; I like people because they are attractive, not
because they are kind.  I always pity children when they
have to kiss grown-ups who have given them presents.
If I were a child, I should not want to kiss the lady who
had given me the prettiest present, but the lady who had
the prettiest face."
</p>

<p>
"But children are taught to show forth their gratitude
not only in their lives but with their lips," suggested
the artist.
</p>

<p>
"It is a senseless plan all the same," laughed Isabel;
"I couldn't bear to think that my friends liked me only
because I was kind to them."
</p>

<p>
"I do not think you need distress yourself on that
score, dear lady."
</p>

<p>
"I want people to like me because I am attractive in
myself&mdash;not because I am amiable."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Madderley shook his head.  "I cannot commend
your prudence; for you will probably cease to be attractive
when you are about five-and-forty, while you can go
on being amiable until you are eighty-nine."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that; hundreds of women are attractive
long after they are five-and-forty."
</p>

<p>
"Of course they are; but they generally belong to the
plump and amiable school.  Tongue is not a dish which
improves by keeping, my dear Lady Disdain."
</p>

<p>
"Wrexham, turn him out of the room, at once," cried
Isabel; "he is becoming insufferable!"
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?  I did not hear," inquired the host,
who was feeding his dogs at that particular moment.
</p>

<p>
"He says my tongue is too sharp."
</p>

<p>
"And he isn't far wrong," sang out Lord Bobby; "if
you don't take care you'll be stung to death by your own
tongue, like the crocodile or the scorpion or some other
old chappie.  You should have seen a girl I took in to
dinner last week; all through dinner she kept saying, 'Oh,
Lord Bobby, how clever you are!'  And she never said
anything else.  Now that is the sort of conversation that
men like; it is far better than the dizzying, fizzying stuff
that brilliant women treat us to."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you like the girls whom you think clever?"
asked Violet.
</p>

<p>
"I like the girls who think me clever a long sight
better; and I don't believe that this is by any means a
peculiar taste."
</p>

<p>
"Young people think and talk too much about what
they like and dislike," said Lady Wrexham, rising from
the table, "when I was a girl I knew what people were
related to each other, and which families were old and
which new; but I did not bother my head about who was
attractive and who was amiable and who was neither."
</p>

<p>
"If you have nothing special to do this afternoon,
Thistletown," said Lord Wrexham, "I wish you would
drive Madderley in the dog-cart to Sunny Hill; I
particularly want him to see the view from there, it is
such a fine one and also so typical of this part of the
country."
</p>

<p>
"I could have better shared a better plan," replied
Bobby; "but my obliging nature cannot say him nay."
</p>

<p>
"You can upset him and break all his bones for being
so rude to me at lunch," suggested Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"That would do him no good.  You may break, you
may shatter his bones if you will, but the outward signs
of an overweening vanity and a most unlovable
disposition will cling to him still."
</p>

<p>
Then the party dispersed, and Isabel went with her
lover to see some model cottages which he had just
built, and which he was particularly anxious to show to her.
She listened patiently while he explained all the improvements,
and then she said: "I wonder if happiness is to be
found in such things as subsoils and artesian wells."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham looked at his cottages with satisfaction.
"Health is to be found in them, and health is
a constituent part of happiness."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps; of course you couldn't be happy without
being healthy; but it doesn't follow that you couldn't be
healthy without being happy.  I wonder in what happiness
really does lie."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; I never thought about it."
</p>

<p>
"But you should think about such things, my dear
Wrexham; it is stupid of you not to, you know."
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot analyze my feelings, as you do; I am
not an introspective person."
</p>

<p>
"I find nothing so interesting as the study of myself,"
said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"That is very likely; but you are an interesting person
and I am not; so the analysis of me would prove a
most wearisome experiment."
</p>

<p>
"That has nothing to do with it.  The analysis of
me is instructive only so far as I am normal, and therefore
uninteresting.  It shows what human nature is like.
When I am original I cease to be interesting from a
scientific point of view."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I don't quite follow you."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you see that in vivisecting a frog, the more
common the frog the more instructive is the experiment?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I can see that."
</p>

<p>
"Then the same principle applies to a woman.  But
do you mean to tell me you never think about your
feelings?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"No; I feel them, and that is enough for me."
</p>

<p>
"That is very tame!"
</p>

<p>
"You see," explained Lord Wrexham, "I have so
many other things to think about.  An estate like this
requires a good deal of management, and I am so anxious
to do my duty by all my tenants and workpeople."
</p>

<p>
"Do you get really interested in the people about the
place, and want to know what they are all thinking and
feeling and caring about?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, my dear young lady; but I want
them to be comfortable and prosperous, and to regard
me as a satisfactory landowner."
</p>

<p>
They walked on in silence for a short time, and then
Isabel said: "Isn't it funny how some people make
everything into a treat by just being there?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite understand what you mean, my dearest."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know how the mere presence of some
people will turn a stuffy little parlour into a fairy palace,
and a dusty street into a byway of Paradise?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely that is somewhat extravagant language,"
replied Lord Wrexham, "of course I know that some
sorts of society are much more congenial than others,
but everybody can see that."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what it is to feel that life is made up
of a lot of strange questions and problems and desires,
and that one person is the answer to them all?"
persisted Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest child, what funny ideas you have!  I am
afraid that you read too much poetry and fiction, and
that it overexcites your brain."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I don't read all that in books," replied Isabel
scornfully.  "I know it of myself; and, by the way, how
many selves have you got?"
</p>

<p>
"How many selves?  Why, only one, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is very one-sided of you!  Now there are
five of me, all neatly labelled and scheduled."
</p>

<p>
"Which are they, I should like to know?" inquired
Lord Wrexham.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! there is my very best ideal self, and my brilliant
society self, and my jolly every-day self, and my ill
and unhappy self, and the demon."
</p>

<p>
"What ever do you mean by the demon?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean me, when I am shallow and selfish and
worldly, and say nasty, sharp things, and care for nothing
but admiration, and am a regular wretch all round."
</p>

<p>
"What is the best self like?"
</p>

<p>
"She learned that the wisdom of this world is foolishness,"
replied Isabel dreamily, "and she found the key
to life's Holy of Holies.  Therefore I killed her, because
she knew too much.  You never met her, and I have
forgotten her, for it is nearly two years since she died."
</p>

<p>
"Really, Isabel, you are a little too prone to let your
imagination run away with you.  But now I want you to
look at this rustic fencing; it is an idea of my own, and
is, I think, most effective."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it is pretty enough," replied Isabel indifferently.
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham's face fell.  "I am so sorry you are
not more pleased with it, my darling; I designed it for
you, and I did so hope that it would give you pleasure.
Is there anything about it you would like different?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no; it is all right."
</p>

<p>
"You see, all my delight now in improving Vernacre
is in making it fitter for you.  It could never be worthy
of such a mistress as it will have; but I hardly let a day
pass without doing something to make it a little more
meet for your acceptance."
</p>

<p>
"It is very good of you," said Isabel gently, as they
turned away.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all; it is mere selfishness on my part, as my
greatest pleasure lies in pleasing you.  I trust you will
not hesitate to mention anything that you would like
different, either in my home or in myself; and, if alteration
is possible, it shall be made."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean you would let me tell you of your faults?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I would," replied Lord Wrexham; "and,
what is more, I would try to correct them."
</p>

<p>
"I once invented a game where every member of the
company was told of one fault by the rest of the party
unanimously, on condition he or she promised to amend
it and not to be offended."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham opened a gate leading into the park.
"Was it a successful pastime?"
</p>

<p>
"It ought to have been, but somehow it wasn't.  It
led to strained relations all round, and yet nobody seemed
to have a fault the less in consequence.  Now, I played
it in the proper spirit, and I cured two bad faults of my
own."
</p>

<p>
"It was very impertinent of anybody to dare to tell
you of your faults, Isabel; and if I had been there I would
have told them so."
</p>

<p>
"No; it wasn't at all impertinent; it was only part of
the game.  I forget what my faults were," continued
Isabel musingly, "but I know I cured them both."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would play that game with me, and tell
me where you would like me to be different," said Lord
Wrexham rather wistfully.  "I know I am stupid, and
not quick at understanding things, but that seems more
a misfortune than a fault; at any rate I don't get over
it, and no one but myself knows how hard I try.  But
anything that I could alter, I gladly would, to make life
with me less dull for you, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't any faults, Wrexham; not a single one."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham smiled with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"But your virtues are rather overcrowded, like the
shrubs at Elton," continued Isabel, "and would be all
the better for a little thinning out."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham's smile faded.  Isabel had a nasty
trick of wiping the smiles clean off the faces of those
that loved her too much.  However, when she saw that
she had hurt her lover, she was seized with compunction,
and began to make amends.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Wrexham, what is that funny little windmill
for at the foot of the hill?"  She knew well enough what
it was for before she asked, but she also knew that Lord
Wrexham would delight in explaining it.
</p>

<p>
His face brightened at once.  "It is a new arrangement
for pumping water up to the house.  You see,
Isabel, we have hitherto drunk the water from a well in
the courtyard, which did quite nicely for us.  But when I
found that you were coming to live at Vernacre I had it
analyzed; and discovered that, although there was nothing
much amiss with it, it was not quite so pure as the
water from a spring at the foot of that hill.  So, by means
of a most ingenious arrangement, the wind pumps all
the drinking water for the house up from that one spring,
which I have proved is the purest water on the estate."
</p>

<p>
"How good you are to me, my dear old boy!"
</p>

<p>
"I want you to have the best of everything, and I
mean to give it you as far as I can.  But I should
like to explain the mechanism of this arrangement to
you, Isabel.  It is a most clever contrivance, I think, and
repays examination."
</p>

<p>
So Isabel listened patiently while her lover expounded
to her how the wind turned the wheel which pumped the
water up to the house, so that much work was
accomplished by means of a very little outlay.
</p>

<p>
"You are so awfully clever at things of this kind," she
said, as they strolled homewards, "I am sure you have
literally more brains in your little finger than most men
have in their stupid heads."
</p>

<p>
"I have not many brains anywhere, I am afraid;
but as I am always thinking about you and wondering
what I can do for your comfort and pleasure, I should
indeed be a poor fool if I did not hit upon the right thing
sometimes."  And Lord Wrexham sighed.
</p>

<p>
"You very often hit upon the right thing.  I don't think
you have any idea what a comfort you are to me, Wrexham.
When my head and heart are tired out they always
come back to you, as if you were a patent soothing syrup
or a provision for old age.  I call you my 'rest cure'."
</p>

<p>
"I am thankful if I bring you any happiness, my child,
in return for the abundant measure you have bestowed
upon me in promising to be my wife; yet I am but a dull
companion for such a brilliant young creature as yourself.
However, when you come to Vernacre for good, we will
always have the house full of young people, so that you
will never have time to be bored by your slow old coach
of a husband."
</p>

<p>
"You are not a slow old coach," cried Isabel
indignantly, "you are the best and dearest man in the
whole world!"
</p>

<p>
"Am I?&mdash;well, it is heaven to me to hear you say so,
whether you really think it or not.  Not that I mean you
would ever say what you did not know to be true; but
you are sometimes carried away by your warm feelings
to say things which exceed the convictions of your cooler
moments."
</p>

<p>
"I know I am," replied Isabel, "but I always try to
be frank and truthful."
</p>

<p>
Her lover smiled rather sadly.  "My dear, it is very
noble of you to be so transparent, and never to pretend
you care more for me than you really do; and my rational
side commends and admires this uprightness.  But now
and then I am weak enough to wish that you would let
me deceive myself a little, and not be so conscientious in
your desire to enlighten me.  A fool's paradise may be
a poor thing; but it is better than no paradise at all."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes filled with tears.  "Oh, Wrexham, how
horrid I must have been to you!"
</p>

<p>
"Never horrid to me, Isabel&mdash;never anything but
charming and fascinating and altogether delightful.  It
is I who am to blame for being somewhat tiresome and
exacting.  Oh! my dear, do you think I don't know how
dull and stupid I am, and how tired you must sometimes
feel of my society?  Yet I am such an old fool that I
like to pretend to myself that I am to you in some
measure what you are to me, though I know perfectly
well all the time that such an idea is absurd and
impossible in the extreme."
</p>

<p>
"What is it in me that makes you like me so much?"
asked Isabel abruptly, as they were watching the sun set
behind the distant hills.
</p>

<p>
"No special thing; I love the whole of you, and your
faults as well as your virtues."
</p>

<p>
"But don't you like me better in some moods than
in others?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so; I always love you just the same;
whatever you do or say, you are you, and that is enough
for me."
</p>

<p>
"But doesn't it make any difference when I am nasty
to you?" persisted Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"It makes all the difference between happiness and
misery, but it does not make any difference in my love
for you."
</p>

<p>
"You are a good man, Wrexham!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, there is no goodness or badness in it.  I am
simply made like that, and I cannot help it."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, you are perfect, whether it is your
own doing or Nature's."
</p>

<p>
"If I were ten times better than I am, I should still
not be half good enough for you."
</p>

<p>
"You'd always take my part, whoever I quarrelled
with, wouldn't you?" coaxed Isabel, sticking a primrose,
she had just gathered, into her lover's button-hole.
</p>

<p>
"Always."
</p>

<p>
"Even if I were wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly the same whether you were wrong or
whether you were right; the merits of the case would
have no effect upon me."
</p>

<p>
Isabel patted his arm.  "Now that is what I call
real justice.  It is qualities such as this that make women
love and respect men."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham laughed, and then said: "Here
we are at the peach-house.  I want you to come and
see some improvements I have just carried out in the
stove, which I think will ensure our getting twice as
many peaches as we have ever had out of this house
before."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon his lordship plunged into a minute
description of the methods whereby his peaches were to be
prematurely ripened, and Isabel gave him her most
satisfying attention.
</p>

<p>
When the walk was over, Isabel went to her own
room and looked at herself in the glass.  "Miss
Carnaby," she said, "you are not really a handsome woman,
and Fate has given you far more than you deserve.  In
exchange for a pretty wit and an indifferent face and a
most admirable figure, you will receive a coronet and
twenty thousand a year, with the best husband in the world
thrown in as a perquisite, like a present of books with
so many pounds of tea.  So the least you can do for the
next forty years is to talk pleasantly and intelligently
about windmills and peach-houses and such like interesting
subjects, remembering that&mdash;if you'd had your own
foolish way&mdash;you might instead have been living upon a
few paltry hundreds a year, with a jealous and
bad-tempered young man who couldn't keep a civil tongue in
his head for two days together."
</p>

<p>
For the rest of the Easter recess Isabel made herself
specially charming to her host.  She was flattered and
petted on all sides, and he was the cause of it, so she felt
accordingly grateful.  The praise which is always
accorded to the woman who doeth well to herself was hers
in full measure just then; and it put her in a good
humour with herself and with her world.  She tried her
utmost not to be bored when Wrexham talked to her
about the things in which he was interested, and she
succeeded, in so far as she hid her boredom from
everybody in the house except herself and him; but, clever
as she was, she was not quite clever enough for that.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
A State Concert.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Rank and wealth I pass unheeding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never giving them their due,<br>
  For my heart and soul are needing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the world but you.<br>
</p>

<p>
"As I have often remarked," said Isabel one hot
June morning, as she and Lady Farley were
sitting together in the latter's boudoir, "the
world&mdash;as the world&mdash;has nothing better to
offer than a State Concert."
</p>

<p>
"I agree with you," replied her aunt, "it combines
the charms of a religious service and a smart party,
and has the advantages of both with the disadvantages
of neither."
</p>

<p>
"The music is always good&mdash;so are the dresses and the
diamonds&mdash;and the Palace is the coolest place in London."
</p>

<p>
"Quite true," said Lady Farley; "and what more
can the heart and flesh of fashionable woman desire?"
</p>

<p>
"Several things.  For instance, my cup of happiness
will not overflow till I have a diamond tiara.  Now there
you have the advantage of me."
</p>

<p>
"But you cannot have a tiara without having a husband
as well; and there you have the advantage of me."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not have the advantage of you long."  And
Isabel laughed.
</p>

<p>
"No; but you will then have the tiara in place of the
advantage."
</p>

<p>
"One of my chief reasons in getting married is to
secure to myself the right of wearing a tiara," remarked
Isabel, "I consider that a woman of thirty without a
tiara is as indecent as a woman of ninety without a cap.
Women must be crowned with either youth or diamonds,
or else must hide their diminished heads under the cloak
of religion, and retire into nunneries and sisterhoods."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, you are too sarcastic for so young a
person; no unmarried woman should ever say nasty
things&mdash;unless she is a professional beauty.  Still, I
hope you will enjoy the Concert to-night, in spite of the
shame of your uncovered head."
</p>

<p>
"I am thankful it is a Concert and not a Ball.  If it
were a Ball, I should have to talk to Wrexham all evening;
but now I can keep silence, and let the dear man feast
his eyes upon the beauties of my irregular profile, instead
of feasting his ears upon the charms of my still more
irregular conversation."
</p>

<p>
"Then poor Wrexham will come badly off to-night,"
said Lady Farley; "for your conversation is infinitely
superior to your profile, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"I know it is; but I wish you would not tread upon
my toes&mdash;or, more correctly, upon my nose&mdash;so ruthlessly.
It is simply fiendish to throw a woman's nose in
her teeth in that fashion."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Isabel!"
</p>

<p>
"I always envy the women with good noses more
than I can express," continued Miss Carnaby, leaning
back in her chair and gazing thoughtfully up to the
ceiling; "eyes grow dim and teeth depart and figures
increase, but a good nose is an abiding resting-place for
your vanity.  You know that it will last out your time,
whatever happens; and that age cannot wither nor
custom stale its satisfactory proportions."
</p>

<p>
"That is so," agreed Lady Farley, tenderly stroking
her own perfect little aquiline.
</p>

<p>
"I always wonder how the women with pretty noses
carry on their advertizing department.  Of course, when
we have good eyes, we call attention to the same by
making use of eye service as men pleasers, so to speak;
and when we have good teeth, we smile as often as is
compatible with the reputation for sanity, and we
frequently complain of the toothache."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! is that your plan of campaign?  I have often
wondered how teeth as white as yours are can ache as
much as you say they do; but now I understand it is
only a ruse."
</p>

<p>
"You misjudge me there, Aunt Caroline.  I know
my teeth are pretty, but they are merely little devils
disguised as angels of light, for I have inherited an estate
of fine and extensive achers.  But you haven't yet
informed me how the well-nosed women call attention to
their stock in trade."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, when a thing is as plain as the nose on
your face it does not require any advertisement, according
to proverbial philosophy."
</p>

<p>
"It is not when it is plain that the necessity arises,"
continued Isabel, "but only when it is pretty."
</p>

<p>
"How absurd you are! Do you talk to Lord Wrexham
like this?"
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious! no; he would think I was out of my
mind, and would recommend some new German baths
or other, which the faculty had discovered as the latest
cure for insanity; and then he would carefully explain to
me the chemical action of the waters upon the tissue of
the human brain."
</p>

<p>
"You really are too bad, Isabel!" said Lady Farley
severely, "Lord Wrexham is a peer, and one of the
best matches in London; and yet you treat him as badly
as if you were marrying him for love.  It is very
incorrect and improvident of you."
</p>

<p>
Isabel opened her blue eyes very wide.  "You don't
have to make love to him for three hours and more at a
stretch, or you would not talk about him in that careless
and happy way.  I confess that the excellent man's
wealth and rank and virtue are unequalled&mdash;save, perhaps,
by his dulness; but, believe me, there is only one
thing on earth more fatiguing than talking to Wrexham,
and that is listening to him.  Take this as a wrinkle
from one who knows."
</p>

<p>
"You should adapt yourself to him, my dear; it does
not do for a man to know that a woman is cleverer than
he is."
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't know it; I do, but I have never let him
find it out.  And as for adapting myself&mdash;why, my dear
aunt, if you heard me talk to him you would take me for
a land-agent or a farm-labourer."
</p>

<p>
"Hardly," said Lady Farley, who was lazily looking
through her list of engagements for the day.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you would.  Personally I prefer talking about
hearts and souls and ideals, to discussing silos and
reaping-machines and land-bills; but Wrexham dotes upon
the latter, so on the latter does my nimble tongue run.
Adaptability is my strong point, don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"And your weak point too, my child.  You are so
exactly what people want you to be, that nobody knows
what the real you is like."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! but <i>I</i> know, more's the pity!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you know more than I do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am wonderfully adaptable; in fact I have
reduced adaptability to a science; I always make myself
five years younger and one degree less intelligent than
the man who takes me in to dinner; that is why I am
so popular."
</p>

<p>
"It is the popular women who make shipwreck of
their lives, and the unpopular ones who sail safely into
pleasant havens.  My experience is that the attractive
women get the nice little things, and the unattractive
ones the nice big things in this world."  And Lady
Farley sighed, as she sat down to answer invitations.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Isabel, rising from her chair and
strolling doorwards, "the latter, out of sheer gratitude,
marry the first man that asks them, and spend the rest
of their lives in returning thanks for his kind inquiry."
</p>

<p>
That night Isabel went with her uncle and aunt to
the State Concert.  The scene was as brilliant as usual,
with the gay dresses and uniforms&mdash;with the daÃ¯s for
Royalty at one end of the great saloon, and the musicians'
gallery at the other, the intervening space being filled
up with the cream of English society.
</p>

<p>
"I say," cried Lord Robert Thistletown, plumping
himself down beside them as soon as they had taken their
seats, "there will be a sound of revelry this night without
a doubt; for I see a chorus out of one of old Wagner's
things down on the programme, and he is the best chap
for making a row I ever came across."
</p>

<p>
"You should not speak disrespectfully of Wagner,"
corrected Isabel, "he is one of the greatest composers&mdash;as
I am one of the greatest conversationalists&mdash;of the
age."
</p>

<p>
"I am not disrespectful; I only think that, compared
with you and Wagner, the rest of the world is silence."
</p>

<p>
"I see it is the <i>Chorus of Flower Maidens</i> out of
<i>Parsifal</i>," remarked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose all those young women in white are the
maidens; but which are the flowers, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Yourself, my dear young friend; you are the flower
of the English aristocracy, don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am.  Yet sometimes I forget that I am
a flower, and behave like a stinging nettle.  That is
when the brilliancy of my wit outruns the benevolence
of my heart."
</p>

<p>
"If you lightly touch a nettle&mdash;&mdash;" Isabel began.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so; you have hit the nail on the head, most
wise young woman.  It is only when you trifle with me
that I become dangerous; 'grasp me like a man of
mettle,' and you will find that the tighter you squeeze me
the more affectionate shall I become."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if 'a man of mettle' means a warrior or an
iron-master," remarked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"It entirely depends upon how you spell the word,
and that again depends upon which type of man you
prefer to grasp, so it is all a matter of taste."
</p>

<p>
"How absurd you are!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't the little boys out of the Chapel Royal choir
look dear?" exclaimed Lord Robert, pointing to the
orchestra.  "It is a sweet dress!  I mean to sing in the
choir of the Chapel Royal when I am grown up, because
the dress is so peculiarly becoming to my style of beauty."
</p>

<p>
"It would be, I should say; and you are just the
right size for it, only about six foot two."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly; scarlet is my colour.  I was always bent
on wearing a scarlet uniform, but I have gone through
agonies of indecision as to whether I should attain that
end through joining the British army or the choir of the
Chapel Royal.  I decided on the former, and made a
mistake; and a mistake is worse than a crime, and only
one degree better than a virtue."
</p>

<p>
"Then what is your reason for resigning the army in
favour of the St. James's choir?" asked Isabel, opening
her huge feather fan.
</p>

<p>
"Merely this, that whenever I am called upon to fight
or to sing, I invariably run away; and my friends consider
that what is a sign of cowardice in the one case becomes
an act of public charity in the other, and that therefore
the choir is my true vocation and calling."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to hear you sing."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, you wouldn't," replied Lord Bobby.
"When I overcome my natural diffidence and give
tongue, the noise is something tremendous; walls tremble,
foundations shake, and roofs are carried bodily away.
One day a traveller in passing through our place asked
if there had been a whirlwind or an earthquake or a siege,
the devastation was so appalling; but he was told that
there had only been a village concert the night before,
and my lordship had sung a couple of comic songs."
</p>

<p>
"It must be a terrible sound!"
</p>

<p>
"It is; that is why I so rarely do it.  As Shakespeare
or Milton or some other old Johnnie remarked, it is all
very well to have a giant's strength, but to use it as a
giant is simply beastly."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it a brilliant scene?" said Isabel.  "I love to
see the stars and garters and things; don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"They are awfully jolly.  Don't you think an order
would suit me?  Then&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With my Bath upon my shoulder and my Garter by my side,<br>
  I'd be taking some great heiress and be making her my bride.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Has your uncle got his ribbon on?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course; he always takes his Bath when he goes
to grand parties," replied Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"How nice and clean of him I And that reminds me
that my mother was overhauling the school-children the
other day down at our place at home, and telling them
that dirt was very wrong and very unwholesome.  'But
please, your ladyship,' piped up a little chap, 'it's very
warm.'  Wasn't that quite too nice?"
</p>

<p>
"Delicious.  Oh! look at the bishops.  Don't they
look dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply sweet; just like lovely, purple, saintly
footmen," agreed Bobby.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw a saintly footman."
</p>

<p>
"But I did: we had one once.  He had conscientious
scruples against saying 'Not at home,' and laying the
wineglasses for dinner.  We bore with that for a long
time, because he was six foot three and very good-looking;
but finally it developed into socialism, and he wanted to
call the governor, Wallingford, and my mother, Augusta.
Then he had to go.  And mother made a rule that for
the future the footmen might keep bicycles, on condition
that they did not want to keep consciences as well."
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense you do talk, Bobby!"
</p>

<p>
"I know I do; it is my greatest charm.  But here
comes Wrexham, so I must resign my seat in his favour,
as if he were a party-leader.  It must be funny to be
engaged, and always obliged to sit by the same person!"
</p>

<p>
Isabel gently fanned herself.
</p>

<p>
"I love variety," continued Bobby, "and I hate having
to take the same woman down to dinner twice in the same
season.  That is one good thing in getting married; you
know then that, whatever happens, there is one woman
you will never have to take in to dinner again as long as
you live.  It is this thought alone which has inspired the
majority of proposals that I have already made."
</p>

<p>
And then Bobby flew off to "fresh woods and
pastures new," while Lord Wrexham sat down beside
Isabel, and began to talk to her in his gently instructive
manner.
</p>

<p>
Isabel was wrong when she said that her lover
had no idea that he bored her.  It may be easy for a
woman to throw dust in the eyes of the men who only
admire her; but the men who love her see too clearly
to be blinded by any paltry artifice, and frequently suffer
accordingly.  Lord Wrexham knew that he bored Isabel,
and the knowledge well-nigh broke his heart; but he
could no more help boring her than he could help
breathing.  He made mistakes in his dealings with her,
and frequently said the wrong thing; therefore Isabel
was hard upon him.  Friendship may pardon our misdeeds;
but it is only love that can forgive our mistakes.
Nevertheless Isabel's lover succeeded in making her
think that he thought she did not think him
stupid&mdash;wherein he showed himself the cleverer of the two.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't the room delightfully cool?" remarked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"It is; the system of ventilation here is admirable.
I wish I could introduce it at Vernacre."
</p>

<p>
"Vernacre is perfect as it is," said Miss Carnaby
graciously, "so please don't begin to improve it.  I am
a good Liberal; and experience has taught me that
there is nothing so deteriorating in its influence as
improvement, nor so retrogressive in its tendency as
reform."
</p>

<p>
"You are joking," replied Lord Wrexham, kindly
explaining to Isabel that she did not mean what she
said, "of course it is true that a too abrupt or sudden
improvement partakes more of the nature of revolution
than of reform; but a slow and steady tendency in a
progressive direction, is the only healthy condition for a
State as for an individual."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, I have noticed that reform generally
means discomfort, and that ventilation invariably means
draughts."
</p>

<p>
"Proper ventilation ought not, however, to mean
draughts; it should change the air imperceptibly, without
causing a strong current anywhere.  But you don't feel
a draught here, do you, dear?" inquired his lordship
anxiously, looking up at the high windows, "because, if
so, I will find you another seat at once."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious! no; how could I, on such a broiling
night?  I should think that even the Ministers are
warm enough now."
</p>

<p>
"Are they not generally?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in their war-paint; bald heads and silk stockings
are very chilly wear; it is like burning the candle
at both ends."
</p>

<p>
"Or rather at neither; as candles are warm instead
of cold."
</p>

<p>
"Of course; you are always right," replied Isabel,
accepting the correction in the letter but not in the
spirit of meekness.  "This room really is a lovely sight,
isn't it?"  She was wondering how soon the Royalties
would arrive.
</p>

<p>
"It is; its proportions are so fine that it never
strikes one as large or small," agreed her lover.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I don't mean that it is a fine sight architecturally;
I mean the company looks so smart.  Everybody
is here&mdash;that is to say, everybody who is anybody."
</p>

<p>
"Well, not quite everybody; you are a little inaccurate,
my dear.  Some people are asked to the second
Concert and the first Ball, instead of to the first Concert
and the second Ball as we have been," explained Lord
Wrexham.  "I do not know how the Lord Chamberlain
picks and chooses, but there is no advantage of one over
the other."
</p>

<p>
"I expect they divide, the people alphabetically,"
observed Isabel absently, looking towards the entrance
at the upper end of the room.
</p>

<p>
"I expect so; that is always a most satisfactory plan
in lists of any kind.  But no," he continued, looking
puzzled, "that cannot be the system, because I am
invited to the first Concert and my name begins with a <i>W</i>."
</p>

<p>
"But there is no reason, that I can see, why the
alphabet should not begin at <i>W</i> and end at <i>V</i> for a
change, instead of the old eternal <i>A</i> and <i>Z</i> system," said
Isabel wickedly.
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham appeared more puzzled than ever.
"It would be most unusual, and I do not see that any
advantage would be gained thereby."
</p>

<p>
"It would be a reform, and that is always a distinct
advantage, don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham's face relaxed.  "Ah! now I see you
are laughing at me," he said pleasantly; and after a
moment's meditation, he began to laugh himself.  "That
was very funny, Isabel&mdash;very funny indeed!  To begin
the alphabet at <i>W</i> by way of a reform!  Capital! capital!
And, as you say, my dear, quite as sensible as many
reforms that are suggested."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" whispered Isabel, "they are coming."
</p>

<p>
And then that silence fell upon everybody which
always falls just before something is going to happen&mdash;be
that something the advent of a royal procession,
or only the more every-day occurrence of dawn.  The
officers of the Household entered walking backwards,
and all the company rose to their feet as the orchestra
struck up the National Anthem.  Finally the Royalties
themselves appeared and bowed to their assembled
guests, while the ladies curtsied in response, till the
room looked like a cornfield when a summer breeze goes
by.
</p>

<p>
When everybody was seated, Isabel whispered to
Lord Wrexham: "I do love anything in the shape of a
function; it gives me a thrill all down my back.  Do you
ever have thrills down your back?"
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham considered for a moment: he never
answered a question hurriedly, lest he should thereby
be led into inaccuracy.  "No, I cannot say that I ever do,
unless I am suffering from the effects of a chill."
</p>

<p>
"Then there must be something wrong with your
back, if 'God Save the Queen' does not send a thrill all
down it.  I would consult a spine doctor if I were you&mdash;a
'bacteriologist' I suppose one would call him."
</p>

<p>
"If you feel a sensation of that kind now, I feel sure
you must be sitting in a draught; I can account for it in
no other way," said Lord Wrexham, his kind face clouded
over with loverlike anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" replied Isabel rather sharply, "what I
feel is no draught, but a deeply rooted human instinct
which cries out for functions both in Church and State;
and that instinct will have to be eradicated before all
forms of Royalty and Ritualism can be abolished from
this best of all possible worlds.  It takes a strong
Government to disestablish an instinct."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot quite follow you, dear; you go too quickly
for a slow old coach like myself, and I am mentally out
of breath with trying to keep up with you.  What
connection can a draught down one's back have with
established methods of worship and government?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about following me; I am not worth
the trouble.  And we must not talk any more; the music
is beginning."
</p>

<p>
After the music began, strange and disturbing thoughts
whirled through Isabel's mind.  Whether it was because
the beauty of sight and sound stimulated her emotional
nature, she could not tell; but the old, aching
hunger for Paul, which she had succeeded in stifling for
so long, woke up and would not be put to silence.  She
looked at the gorgeous scene around her, and realized
that the world had given her of its best; she had bartered
her heart and her soul for its glory and honour, and the
price had been paid her to the uttermost farthing.  She
had nothing to complain of on that score; and she was
too clever and experienced a woman to call the triumph
she had accomplished dust and ashes.  It was a good
enough thing in its way, only it was not Paul&mdash;and Paul,
unfortunately, was the only thing that she cared for.  It is
absurd to call worldly success worthless, because it does
not happen to be the precise thing that we personally
desire; just as it would be absurd to call roast beef
uneatable, when we happen to be thirsty rather than hungry.
But we want what we want, and not what is suitable or
convenient or wise&mdash;and nothing else in the whole world
will satisfy us.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the saddest, if not one of the most
comforting, things in life, that when people have caught a
glimpse of the best, the second-best can never again
content them.  If they have once&mdash;be it only for a
moment&mdash;worn the best robe and sat down to the feast,
they will never more really enjoy the husks of the far
country; even though the citizens of that country
prepare the same with their most delicate arts, and serve
them up on gold plate.  Unwise men do not consider
this, and fools do not understand it; so that the former
find out too late that their souls must be starved to
death for lack of that better thing which they once so
carelessly threw away; while the latter enjoy their
husky diet in peace, unknowing that there is any better
thing at all.
</p>

<p>
Isabel Carnaby belonged to the former class.  She
was wise enough to recognize the best when she saw it;
and foolish enough, having seen it, to let it go.  She
might have been a happy woman, had she had more heart
or less; but, now, such as she had was breaking.  Suddenly
the veil, which she had so carefully draped in front
of her inner life, was ruthlessly torn away, and the ideal
self, whom she thought she had slain, woke up in the
renewed strength of a long slumber; and she knew that
she loved Paul as she had loved him in the beginning and
as she would love him to the end, and that no other man
could ever supplant him in her love or in her life.  She
could have laughed aloud at the grim irony of the thing,
as she realized that the brilliant scene around her, with its
perfection of everything that civilization has to offer, was
as nothing in her eyes in comparison with a quaint little
chapel in an old-fashioned country town, where she and
Paul once stood side by side and sang a hymn together.
</p>

<p>
"How these people would laugh at me," she said to
herself, "if they knew that I would gladly give up all the
best music of the finest orchestras in London, to hear
once more 'There is a land of pure delight' sung in a
Methodist chapel!  But, all the same, I would."
</p>

<p>
When the concert was over and they went into the
supper-room, Isabel was strangely quiet and subdued;
which convinced Lord Wrexham more forcibly than ever
that she had been sitting in a draught and would be ill
next day.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I wish you had a little wrap with you," he
said, "to put on when you walk along the corridors and
through the drawing-rooms."
</p>

<p>
"Well I haven't," replied Isabel; "I am so fond of
giving little raps to my friends that I don't keep any for
myself&mdash;which perhaps is too altruistic on my part."
</p>

<p>
When they had had supper and were leaving the
Palace, Lord Robert Thistletown drew Isabel on one side.
"I only just want to say good-bye to you," he said; and
she saw, to her surprise, that his usually rosy face was
very white.
</p>

<p>
"Why, where ever are you going to, Bobby, that you
should say good-bye instead of good-night?"
</p>

<p>
"I am starting with my regiment for India to-morrow.
There is some nasty fighting out there, don't you know?
and we are ordered to the front."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Bobby!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is a piece of awfully good luck for me
to see active service so soon, and I should be wild with
delight if it wasn't for Violet.  But somehow the things
you want always seem to come to you just as soon as
you've left off wanting them."
</p>

<p>
"Have you spoken to Violet?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I did not mean to.  I thought it was more honourable
to leave her free till I came back, and all that sort
of thing.  But I went to say good-bye to her to-day, and
it somehow popped out without my intending it.  I am
afraid I was rather a selfish brute to tell her, considering
how young she is; but she looked so pretty I could
not help it."  And Bobby tugged at his moustache
regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"Don't regret it," said Isabel earnestly, "men have an
idiotic notion that it is the proper thing to keep a woman
in ignorance of the fact that they love her, till they are
ready with the marriage-settlements; it never appears to
occur to them that to her the settlements are of no
importance compared with the love."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm so poor that when we get to the settlements
they'll only be strait settlements," replied Bobby, with
a rueful attempt to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that.  Always remember that to a man,
love-making is the prologue to marriage; but to a woman,
marriage is the epilogue to making-love."
</p>

<p>
"Then good-bye," whispered Lord Bobby, squeezing
her hand very tight, and manfully swallowing down a
silly lump that would come in his throat, "and if I am
potted by the niggers, you'll comfort my little girl, won't
you, and teach her to forget?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes filled with tears.  "My dear boy, I cannot
teach her that, for I have not learnt it myself; it is an
art never mastered by women.  But I will teach her that
there is really no such thing as forgetfulness just as
there is really no such thing as death."

CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
Among the Wounded.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  There were many who strove in the battle of life,<br>
  Who shared in the struggle and joined in the strife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fought to their uttermost breath;<br>
  But some stood aside while the battle rolled by,<br>
  And lifted to heaven an agonized cry&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are wounded," they said, "to the death!"<br>
</p>

<p>
"Wrexham," said Isabel to her lover the next
day, as they were sitting in the drawing-room
in Prince's Gate, "I am going to
make you unhappy, but I cannot help it."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham's face grew anxious.  "I know what
it is; you caught cold last night, and you fear you are
going to be ill.  I was afraid there was a draught all the
time."
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't that&mdash;it is something much worse," replied
Isabel gently; she was very patient with Wrexham now.
</p>

<p>
"Then tell me the worst at once.  I cannot bear
suspense where you are concerned."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't mind very much, dear," said Isabel,
laying her hand caressingly on his coat-sleeve, "but I
cannot marry you."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham turned very white.  "Cannot marry
me?  What ever do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that I have been deceiving myself all along,
and that I do not really love you, though I admire and
esteem and respect you with all my heart."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dearest, I never for a moment supposed that
you did love me.  I used sometimes to pretend to myself
that you did, because it made me so happy; but I really
knew all the time that it was absurd to expect a brilliant
and attractive woman like you to fall in love with such a
stupid old fellow as I am.  I only asked to be allowed to
love you; and I ask that still."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't fair to take the best that you have to
offer, and only to give you scraps in return," cried Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I am the best judge of that; and surely if I am
content it is all right."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't all right, Wrexham; I love some one else."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham shaded his face with his hand.
"Well?" was all he said, but the voice in which he said
it was not his own.
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes were full of pity as she looked at him.
"I will be candid with you at last," she said, "but please
remember that it was myself I was deceiving, and not you.
Even I could not sink so low as to wilfully deceive such a
good man as you are."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, do not excuse yourself to me.  Remember
that whatever you do or leave undone I shall never blame
you, nor allow any one else to do so.  My queen can do no
wrong."
</p>

<p>
"I was angry with Paul Seaton because I thought he
had ceased to love me," continued Isabel hurriedly, "I
had no right to think so, but I got the idea into my head
and it would not go.  And I was so wild with anger and
misery, that I said hard and cruel things to him that can
never be forgiven; and I drove him out of my life, and
pretended that I did not mind."
</p>

<p>
"My poor, wayward, petulant child!"
</p>

<p>
"And then I persuaded myself that I did not care for
the deeper things of life, but could be happy with money
and rank and pleasure and such trifles as these.  And
people flattered me and admired me, and I thought that I
was content, and that my love for Paul had been only a
girlish fancy."
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham drew his breath hard, but he did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"But after a time I found myself growing hard and
bitter, and I knew that my youth was going, and that I
had nothing to show for it.  And then you came by, and
offered me everything that society counts worth having.
I was a woman of the world, and I knew that if I became
Lady Wrexham my apparent failure would be changed
into a glorious success.  So I accepted you."
</p>

<p>
"I see."
</p>

<p>
"Yet I was not altogether base," Isabel went on; "I
love you in a restful, prosaic kind of way; and I thought
that that would be enough, and that the sort of love I
had given to Paul was a dream of the past which I could
never dream again.  But I was wrong.  My love for Paul
Seaton is no half-forgotten vision, but the strongest thing
in me; and I cannot marry any other man."
</p>

<p>
"My darling, I quite understand," said Lord Wrexham;
"it was only natural that a dull man like myself should
fail to win your love.  You could not help it any more
than I could, so we are neither of us to blame."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "It was not that; it had
nothing to do with you.  Whatever you had been, it would
have made no difference.  You were not Paul, and that
was all that mattered to me."
</p>

<p>
"But Mr. Seaton is a clever man and a very brilliant
writer," said Lord Wrexham generously, though he took
care to use the prefix <i>Mr.</i>
</p>

<p>
"That has nothing to do with it either.  He is
clever, I admit, and kind and good; but so are scores
of other men that I have known.  I cannot tell you
why I love him so much.  I only know that to me
he is the only man in the whole world, and always
will be."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I hope you will be very happy with him."  And
the kind voice trembled.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, there is no chance of that.  I have offended
him past all forgiveness.  Please don't think I have
broken off my engagement with you because I am going
to marry my old lover.  I shall not marry anybody, but
shall count as one of society's failures; and people will
pity me as they see me growing old all by myself.  Yet I
shall not be altogether hard and bitter, because I have
tasted what love is like; and having once tasted it (even
though I dashed the cup from my lips with my own
hands) I can never drink of any other.  But, oh! Wrexham,
how can I ever forgive myself for having hurt
you?"  And then Isabel's torrent of words was stopped
by a torrent of tears.
</p>

<p>
Lord Wrexham rose from his chair and laid his hand
on her bowed head.  "My dear, there must never be any
question of forgiveness between you and me, for I was
yours to do what you liked with.  We both made a
mistake&mdash;you in thinking that you could be content with me,
and I in dreaming that I could make you happy.  But if
ever you get tired of growing old alone, remember that
there are always one man's heart and hand waiting for
you, if you should choose to take them."
</p>

<p>
And before Isabel could answer him he was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Always one man's heart and hand waiting for me, even
when I grow old and horrid," she said to herself through
her tears, "and he never even remembered that there was
Vernacre and a coronet as well.  How good he is, and
what a gentleman!"
</p>

<p>
During the next few weeks Isabel devoted herself to
the comforting of Violet Esdaile, who accepted the
consolation with the egotism of youth, never noticing that
the heart of the comforter was even heavier than her own.
To Violet the whole world was one huge background to
Bobby Thistletown, and all other persons and events
mere incidents therein; just as one sometimes sees prints
of the Duke of Wellington with the battle of Waterloo
and the Great Exhibition of '51 thrown in, as small
adjuncts to the distant view, to add lustre to the central
figure.  We most of us have portraits of this kind hidden
away somewhere in our hearts; and to a person with a
sense of humour it would be interesting to note the relative
importance of the figures and their surroundings.  At first
sight it seems funny that the University of Oxford should
have been founded by King Alfred, and enriched by the
art and learning of the centuries, merely to serve as a
background for one particular graduate; or that London
should have out-Babyloned Babylon, and become the
greatest city in the world, in order to supply the near
distance for the portrait of one special woman.  But looked
at with the seeing eye and the understanding heart these
things are not really funny at all; any more than it is funny
for the cluster of the Pleiades to take up apparently less
space than an ordinary wedding-ring, or for the Great
Nebula in Orion to seem more insignificant than the hand
of a little child.
</p>

<p>
Many times a day did Isabel listen to a catalogue of
Bobby's excellencies, and many times a day did she
willingly say Amen to them all; for though Violet was too
young to think that any man mattered except Bobby,
Isabel was old enough to know that all men mattered
because of Paul.  So Isabel went down to Esdaile Court
with her relations; and there spent her days in talking
about Bobby and her nights in dreaming about Paul.
</p>

<p>
There was one dreadful day at Esdaile when Bobby's
name appeared in the list of the wounded; and a glorious
one when England rang with his praises, because the
news came that he had received his wounds in going back
under fire&mdash;after he had himself reached a place of
safety&mdash;to rescue a fallen comrade.
</p>

<p>
Then followed one of those wretched weeks when the
days are punctuated by telegrams and bulletins instead of by
meal-times and sun-risings; and after a time there came
one of those blessed seasons, known to most of us, when
those who have come back from the gates of the grave
combine the pathetic sacredness of the dead with the
sweet familiarity of the living, and we feel that we can
never be angry with their faults nor irritated by their
follies any more.  Of course we can, and are, and shall
be, because there is much that is human both in us and
them; but at first we do not believe it possible, because
there is also in both of us something that is divine.
</p>

<p>
It was in this same summer&mdash;though rather earlier
than the date of Lord Robert Thistletown's going to
India&mdash;that the editor of <i>The Hours</i> died; and it was generally
supposed in literary circles that the brilliant young
writer, Paul Seaton, would take his place.  There were
many who hoped for the post, as it was one which united
great political influence with considerable pecuniary
advantage; but there was no doubt in the minds of the
initiated that Seaton was the man for the place; as, in
addition to his qualifications as a man of letters, his
political views were almost identical with those of Sir
John Shelford, the proprietor of the paper.
</p>

<p>
Early in June Paul ran down home for a week, to
discuss with his people the change in his life and fortunes
which appeared imminent; for to Paul himself&mdash;as to
the rest of his profession&mdash;his selection as editor of <i>The
Hours</i> seemed a foregone conclusion.
</p>

<p>
There were other reasons, besides the satisfying of his
ambition, that made Paul greatly desire this appointment.
As the editor of <i>The Pendulum</i> he was a poor man,
but as the editor of <i>The Hours</i> he would be a rich one;
and he specially wanted money just then, as things were
looking dark in the Cottage at Chayford.  For the last
few months Joanna's health had been causing much
anxiety to her parents, and Mrs. Seaton was not as
strong as she had been; and it is in times of sickness
and adversity that the pinch of poverty hurts most.
</p>

<p>
"Do you very much want to be the editor of <i>The
Hours</i>?" asked Joanna one day.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Paul; "more than I thought I
should ever want anything again.  Besides the pay&mdash;which
it would be affectation to pretend that I am
indifferent to&mdash;it is a position of such tremendous influence.
The editor of <i>The Hours</i> sways more opinions than I
should like to say."
</p>

<p>
"You are very fond of power, Paul," said his mother.
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled sadly.  "It is all that is left to me, you see;
and a man must have something to set his heart upon."
</p>

<p>
One morning, when Paul was the last to appear at
the breakfast-table, Joanna greeted him with the cry:
"There is a letter for you from the office of <i>The Hours</i>,
and I am sure it is to say that the appointment is yours."
</p>

<p>
Paul broke the seal and found it was a communication
from Sir John Shelford.  It was a kind enough
letter, and full of regrets; but Sir John said that he
could not conscientiously give a post of such far-reaching
influence as that of editor of <i>The Hours</i> to the man who
wrote <i>Shams and Shadows</i>.  Paul's political views, he
added, were his own; Paul's literary style and knowledge,
all that could be desired; nevertheless it would not be
right for the man who had more to do, perhaps, with the
forming of public opinion in England than any other,
to be held responsible for the unsound political teaching
and the untrue philosophy of life which were found
in the pages of <i>Shams and Shadows</i>.  Sir John went on to
speak in most flattering terms of <i>Some Better Thing</i>, and
to say that such a book placed its author in the first
rank of living men of letters, "but," he continued, "you
are too much a man of the world to need telling that
<i>litera scripta manet</i>, and that what a man has written he
has written;" and he showed that, because of <i>Shams
and Shadows</i>, Paul could never realize his ambition
and become the editor of <i>The Hours</i>.
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a few moments after Paul had
ceased reading, and Mrs. Seaton began to cry quietly
behind the coffee-pot.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, mother," he said manfully, though his
face was pale and tired, "it is no good making a trouble
of things.  I don't deny that it is a disappointment, but
I can bear it all right if only you won't let it make you
unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"But it is so hard," sobbed Mrs. Seaton, "that a man
should be punished for a thing of which he repented long
ago."
</p>

<p>
"But the world never forgives," sighed the minister;
"it is only God and our mothers that can do that."
</p>

<p>
"I think that Shelford is an old beast," cried Joanna
warmly, "and I hope that the new editor, whoever he is,
will ruin the paper, and cause all the Shelfords to die in
the workhouse."
</p>

<p>
Paul tried to smile.  "I cannot help seeing that Shelford
is right.  The editor of <i>The Hours</i> must be above
suspicion, from a literary and political point of view, or
else the prestige of the paper will go down at once.  Men
in positions of great influence should never have anything
to explain away."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems to me a great shame," repeated
Mrs. Seaton, wiping her eyes, "that people should be
punished for things after they have been sorry, and have
done all in their power to undo them."
</p>

<p>
"Still it is the way of the world," replied Paul, "when
a wrong has once been done there is no undoing it, but
the punishment must be borne and the debt paid to the
uttermost farthing."
</p>

<p>
"It is a most disgusting piece of injustice!" exclaimed
Joanna.
</p>

<p>
Paul pretended to go on with his breakfast.  "No, it
isn't; it is perfectly just.  For everything we do or leave
undone we must sooner or later pay the bill, and we
should take this into account before we give our orders
to Fate.  I am now paying the bill for the writing of
<i>Shams and Shadows</i>."
</p>

<p>
"But you are sorry that the book ever was written,
aren't you?" asked Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I should rather think I am; far sorrier than any one
else can ever be.  Still I was a free agent, and what I
did I did with my eyes open, and now that the bill has
come in, I mean to pay up like a man, and not grumble.
It is only a fool that builds a tower or goes to war
without counting the cost."
</p>

<p>
"The cost is very heavy this time," said Mr. Seaton;
"it is bad enough when a thing costs only money, but it
is worse when it costs other things."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Shams and Shadows</i> has cost me a good deal more
than money," said Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I know it has," replied his father, "and I hoped
that the debt would have been forgiven you."
</p>

<p>
Paul smiled.  "It is a vain hope now-a-days to
imagine that when we go down into Egypt to buy corn,
the money will be put back into our sacks' mouths.
Sometimes it happens, but only to Fortune's favourites;
and I have never been one of these.  But if we are
obliged to pay our bills, we need not talk about them,
if you don't mind."
</p>

<p>
So the subject of conversation was changed; but for
the rest of the day Joanna murmured to herself at
intervals, when nobody was listening: "Old Shelford is a
beast!"
</p>

<p>
When the minister and Joanna had gone for their
usual walk, Paul sat in the dining-room with his mother
and her knitting, and played with her ball of wool, just
as he had done when he was a little boy.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, where is Isabel Carnaby now?" asked
Mrs. Seaton suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Paul winced, but he answered quietly: "She is still
in town, and is to be married to Lord Wrexham, I believe,
at the end of this season".
</p>

<p>
"I was very fond of Isabel."
</p>

<p>
"I know you were, mother; so was I."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of a man is Lord Wrexham?"
</p>

<p>
"He is the best type of an English gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"Then you think he will make Isabel happy?" said
Mrs. Seaton, with a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"I did not say that," replied Paul, dropping the ball
of wool on the floor, and diving after it.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he will make her happy?" persisted
Mrs. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
Paul was silent for a moment before he answered:
"Not as happy as I could have made her".
</p>

<p>
"He won't understand her, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Paul, why did you ever let her go?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I was a poor man.  If her marriage with
me had involved no sacrifice on her part, I would have
fought to the death rather than give her up; and I would
have made her marry me in spite of everything, for I
know I could have made her happy.  But I could not
force her to accept poverty after I had seen that she
hung back."
</p>

<p>
"But love matters more to a woman than anything
else; and she would rather be poor with the man she
loves than be rich without him."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think that you and Joanna quite understand
how much wealth and rank and things of that kind
matter to a woman brought up as Isabel has been," said
Paul, "to you, they are outside considerations which do
not enter into your inner life at all; but to her, they
are the very air she breathes."
</p>

<p>
"Then, do you mean to say that she could not be
happy without them?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't; I think, on the contrary, that it is not
in the nature of such things to make Isabel happy.  But
she would have to resign them of her own free will.
I could hardly force her to sacrifice them because I
happened to think that she could be happy without
them&mdash;especially as my own happiness depended upon her
sacrifice,"
</p>

<p>
"I see what you mean; had she chosen poverty you
would have made it sweet to her, but you did not feel
at liberty to force poverty upon her against her will."
</p>

<p>
"That was just it," continued Paul; "as long as I
saw that my love satisfied her, I knew that I held her
happiness in the hollow of my hand, and I was not
afraid of poverty for herself or for me; but when I
found that she was beginning to shrink from the hard
life she had chosen, I felt it was but manly to let her
go."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know I was afraid at one time that you had
been hard on her, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"So I was at first&mdash;hard and bitter and proud; but
when love comes on to the scene, pride has to knuckle
under and hardness soon melts away.  Just at first, I
own, my pride held me back from her, because of some
things she had said; but I soon forgave her, as I knew
she was angry at the time and did not mean them; and
I should have forgiven her just the same, even if she
had," he added, smiling at himself.
</p>

<p>
"Do you still care for her?" asked Mrs. Seaton,
knitting furiously in her excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; nothing can ever alter that.  Isabel will
always be the one woman in the world to me."
</p>

<p>
"Then why, oh! why didn't you go and tell her so,
and beg her to come back to you and let bygones be
bygones?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you&mdash;simply because she was rich and
I was poor.  If it had been the other way, I would have
made her come back to me, and would have held her
against the whole world.  I could easily have put my
own pride into my pocket; but her comfort was a
different thing, and could not be so easily disposed of."
</p>

<p>
"But if she were rich and you were poor, you must
remember also that she was a woman and you were a
man, and that the first advances should have come from
you.  The pride of womanhood is a stronger instinct than
the pride of poverty," persisted Mrs. Seaton; "and then
you must not forget <i>Shams and Shadows</i>"
</p>

<p>
"I am hardly likely to do so," replied Paul rather
bitterly, "at present there seems no necessity for me to
keep a book-marker in that excellent work to prevent it
from slipping from my memory altogether."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear boy, do you mean to tell me that even
after <i>Shams and Shadows</i>, with its cruel satire against
a woman of fashion, was published, you expected Isabel
to come back to you of her own accord?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Paul, you do not understand women."
</p>

<p>
"Evidently not, worse luck for me!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton's eyes filled with tears.  "I am afraid
you have made a great mistake, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"I am always making them; and I find they come
very expensive in the end.  But I think I'll go out for a
walk now; I have got such a thundering headache," said
Paul, rising from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"I would, love; it will do you good."
</p>

<p>
But when he had reached the door Paul turned back,
and knelt down beside Mrs. Seaton's chair and put his
arms round her, as he used to do when he was a little
child.  "I don't know how it is," he said, "but everything
I care for turns to disappointment just as it seems to be
within my grasp; I was so sure of myself, and meant to
be such a brilliant success, and yet I have failed all
along the line.  Oh! mother, comfort me."
</p>

<p>
And his mother comforted him as only his mother could.

CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
Joanna.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  There is many a cruel thorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a roaring lion,<br>
  Many a stone by footsteps worn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road that leads to Zion.<br>
</p>

<p>
Early in October Isabel came back to town, and
again took up her abode at her uncle's house in
Prince's Gate.  Lady Farley had been naturally
much disappointed at the breaking off of her
niece's engagement with Lord Wrexham, but she was too
just not to see that, after all, Isabel was old enough to
please herself, and that a woman on the threshold of the
thirties was too old to be scolded.  She was perfectly
conscious that, from a social point of view, Isabel was
fast writing herself down a failure; and therefore, for the
first time in her life, Lady Farley did not disguise from
her niece her high opinion of that niece's attractions.
</p>

<p>
Like Horace Walpole, Lady Farley knew her world;
and she had learned that it is when we fail, that a little
flattery is beneficial to us; also, that we do not thank the
friend who admires our excellencies, but for the stranger
who openly exalts the strength of our weak places we
reserve our undying devotion.  So her ladyship was very
complimentary to Isabel just then.
</p>

<p>
The first Sunday afternoon after Isabel's return,
Edgar Ford called at the Farleys'; and, after a few
customary banalities, Miss Carnaby inquired how the
Seatons were getting on.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all well, I am sorry to say," replied Edgar;
"Joanna is very ill, and Mrs. Seaton seems to be
breaking up."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I am so sorry; do tell me all about them,"
begged Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Joanna has been ailing all the summer; and
now the doctors say that the only thing that could save
her life would be a winter at Davos, and that she will run
the greatest risk if she attempts to remain in England."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes filled with tears; somehow lately all the
gilt and the sunshine on things had vanished, and she
kept seeing the underlying sadness of life whichever way
she turned.
</p>

<p>
"Of course the Seatons are not at all well off,"
continued Edgar, "and a winter abroad is always
a costly business for any one; but Paul, I believe, is ready
to defray all Joanna's expenses, so that no burden shall
fall upon his father.  The difficulty, however, is that there
is no one to go with her, and she is far too delicate to go
alone."
</p>

<p>
"That is a serious difficulty," said Lady Farley.
</p>

<p>
"They cannot find any one who happens to be going and
who would take charge of her: besides, it would be hard
for the poor girl to go out, perhaps to die, with strangers;
and the journey would kill Mr. or Mrs. Seaton right out,
even if they could afford it."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't her brother take her?" Lady Farley suggested.
</p>

<p>
Edgar shook his head.  "He could not possibly spare
the time.  He is such an unselfish fellow that he would
gladly go with Joanna if it could be managed, and take
every care of her; but he could not leave London for
several months without resigning his appointment as
editor of <i>The Pendulum</i>; and if he did that, he could
not afford to pay even Joanna's expenses, much less his
own."
</p>

<p>
Then Lady Farley&mdash;being tired of the Seatons as a
subject of conversation&mdash;began to talk about other things,
while Isabel dispensed the tea which had just been brought
in.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I must be off," Edgar said at last, "for
I am going to the service at St. James's Hall to-night, and
it is impossible to get a seat unless one is there half an
hour before the time."
</p>

<p>
"I have never been," said Isabel, "I should like to
go and see what it is like."  She felt great leanings
towards anything connected with Methodism just then;
not from any special sympathy with the teachings of
John Wesley, but simply because Methodism&mdash;like yellow
roses&mdash;reminded her of Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Then come with me now!  I will take great care
of her, Lady Farley, and bring her back safe and sound."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; go, my dear," said her ladyship kindly, "if you
think it will interest you."  Lady Farley regarded
religious services as she regarded love affairs, namely, as
seemly diversions <i>pour passer le temps</i>.
</p>

<p>
So Isabel ran upstairs to put on what women call
"her things," and then she and Edgar repaired to
St. James's Hall.
</p>

<p>
When they arrived there the hall was practically
full, though it was a good half-hour before the beginning
of the service; but the congregation kept streaming in,
and by seven o'clock every corner was densely packed,
and people were standing in the doorways and the
passages.
</p>

<p>
"This crowded audience looks more like a political
meeting than a religious service," whispered Isabel to
Edgar, with that surprise which we all feel when God,
for the time being, occupies public attention to the
exclusion of Man, and heaven instead of earth becomes the
topic of the hour.
</p>

<p>
"It is a wonderful sight!" Edgar whispered back;
"there is nothing like it in London."
</p>

<p>
The whole scene stirred Isabel strangely.  Not only
was the crowd very large, but it consisted chiefly of men;
a great number of them were soldiers in their scarlet
uniforms, and almost all of them were counted among
those poor to whom it has been promised that the Gospel
shall be preached.  These were none of the well-to-do
people who go to church or to chapel, as they go to court,
because it is the correct thing to pay homage to the
heavenly as to the earthly Sovereign; but working men,
whose hearts as well as whose hands had been scarred
and hardened by the ceaseless grind of poverty and toil.
On the platform behind the minister's desk sat a row
of sweet-faced Sisters of the Poor, in their plain black
gowns and long grey veils; while again behind them
came the band, and a crowd of "workers," filling the
enormous platform of St. James's Hall up to the roof.
</p>

<p>
A less emotional woman than Isabel Carnaby would
have been thrilled at the sound of a hymn sung by so
vast a concourse of people, and at the sight of so large a
number gathered together with one accord in one place;
and when the time for the sermon came, and the preacher
showed forth some of the sorrows of the world, and
echoed its great cry for help, she felt that there was
no resisting that appeal.  Until now she had been one of
the careless daughters&mdash;one of the women that are at
ease; and she had been deaf to the weeping and the
wailing inside the prison walls of poverty.  But at last her ears
had been opened, and she had heard the sorrowful sighing
of the prisoners appointed to die; and she felt she must
be up and doing, and must take her part in stemming
the torrent of the world's great flood of tears.
</p>

<p>
She and Edgar said little on their way home; and
each understood that the heart of the other was too full
for speech.
</p>

<p>
The next day Isabel wrote the following letter:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"MY DEAR MRS. SEATON,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"I am so dreadfully sorry to hear from Mr. Ford
that Joanna is ill; I cannot tell you how unhappy it has
made me, but I think you will understand without being told.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"I am full of hope that a winter at Davos will set her
right again, as I have known it work such wonderful cures.  But I
hear your difficulty is that she can find nobody to accompany her;
and therefore I am writing to ask if I may offer my services.  I would
promise to take every care of her; and my maid&mdash;who is an
experienced nurse as well as a most faithful old servant&mdash;would look
after us both.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"I could be ready to start in a fortnight from now; and could
arrange to stay as far into the spring as the doctors thought
desirable on Joanna's account.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours lovingly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ISABEL CARNABY."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter brought great joy to the little home at
Chayford.  Mrs. Seaton's first impulse was to close with
Isabel's offer at once, and so ensure a chance of recovery
for Joanna; but she felt that anything connected with
Isabel was Paul's business, and that therefore she could
settle nothing without first consulting him.  So she wrote
a loving letter to Isabel, telling the latter how grateful
both Joanna and her parents were for this great kindness,
but that Paul was undertaking the entire management
of his sister's journey, so the final arrangements must
rest with him.
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Seaton forwarded Isabel's letter to Paul,
bidding him deal with it as he thought best.  "I am not
doing this in order to bring Paul and Isabel together
again," she said to herself, "but entirely on Joanna's
account; I should have done just the same had Miss
Dallicot made the offer instead of Isabel, for it is clearly
Paul's duty to make all the arrangements he can for
his sister's comfort.  It is purely a matter of business."  Then
a smile stole round the corners of her mouth as she
added: "It will all come right again as soon as they see
each other, and my boy will be as happy as he deserves
to be".
</p>

<p>
For Paul's mother had heard of the breaking off of
the Wrexham engagement, and had drawn her own conclusions.
</p>

<p>
A day or two after this, Isabel received a letter from
Paul:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"MY DEAR MISS CARNABY,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"My mother has forwarded to me your most
kind and generous offer of help to us in our present difficulty, as it is
I who am taking all the responsibility of Joanna's illness.  I feel that
we cannot refuse the offer without due consideration, because the
plan that you propose would prove such an inestimable benefit to
my sister; nor can we, on the other hand, accept it without due
consideration, because it would be a most serious undertaking
for you.  Therefore, if you will allow me, I will call upon you
to-morrow afternoon to discuss the matter more fully than we
can do by letter.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours gratefully,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PAUL SEATON."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As Paul wrote the above, he laughed at his own folly.
"What a fool I am!" he said to himself, "of course I
could manage it perfectly by writing, if I wanted to do
so; but I am as excited as a boy of twenty at the mere
idea of seeing her face and hearing her voice again.  I
wonder if Lord Wrexham minded being thrown over by
her as much as I did; if so, I pity him with all my
heart."
</p>

<p>
So Paul Seaton and Isabel Carnaby saw each other
face to face once more.  Because they were well-bred
people&mdash;and, moreover, a man and woman of the world&mdash;they
met apparently with perfect ease and without any
disquieting emotion; although Paul's heart beat like a
regimental drum all the time, and Isabel felt as if a little
bird were fluttering in the middle of her throat.  A casual
observer would have thought that they were ordinary
acquaintances, who had seen each other the day before;
and the only difference that the most experienced eye
could have detected was that they were neither quite as
clever as usual.  They did not seem to look at one
another with any special attention; and yet in the first
ten seconds that they were together, Paul knew that Isabel
was thinner than of old, and that there had come a tired
look into the blue eyes; and Isabel perceived that there
were many grey hairs round Paul's temples, and that
she and Time together had managed to plough some deep
furrows across his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" began Isabel, talking a shade
faster than her wont, "it is very good of such a busy
man to spare the time to come and see me."
</p>

<p>
"It is very good of you to let me come," replied
Paul, "but it is so much easier to talk over plans than
to write about them."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us get to business at once," suggested
Isabel hurriedly, "as I daresay you have not much time
to spare."
</p>

<p>
She really meant that she had not much courage to
spare; but we so rarely say what we actually mean.
And why should we?  The understanding people know
without our saying, and it doesn't matter whether the
stupid ones know or not.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," agreed Paul, who happened to be one
of the understanding people, "I know it is very bad
manners to be in a hurry, but unfortunately I nearly
always am.  I believe my health will be permanently
impaired by the scalding state in which I always have
to swallow cups of tea during afternoon calls.  Long
and bitter experience has taught me that unless you
can fly before you hear the distant rattle of the tea-cups,
you are lost; if once tea is within ear-shot, escape
becomes impossible till the cup is drained to the dregs.
If you leave in the interval between the sound of tea and
its outpouring, you somehow cast a slur upon the
quickness of your hostess's servant."
</p>

<p>
Paul knew perfectly well about that little bird fluttering
in Isabel's throat, and he talked on at random in
order to give her time to recover herself.
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "Well, I am glad that the tea is here
now, so that you can have a cup at once and drink it at
your leisure."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  And now, about Joanna.  I cannot tell
you how grateful I am to you for your most kind
suggestion; but before we go into that, I want you to
consider what it will mean to you.  At present I think
you have no idea of the sacrifice which it will involve on
your part."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind that; the greater the sacrifice the
better it will be for me.  You see, I have done nothing
but help myself for thirty years, and now I think it is
time I began to help other people."
</p>

<p>
"But this is such a big beginning," persisted Paul;
"it means shutting yourself up for six months in an
atmosphere of sickness, and possibly of death; and this
is a tremendous undertaking for any woman, especially
for one who has hitherto had all the wheels of life oiled
for her."
</p>

<p>
"But think of Joanna."
</p>

<p>
"I am trying not to think of her, till I have done
thinking of you.  Of course my first impulse was to
thank you on my knees for thus coming to our help; but
you must be considered as well as Joanna; and I am not
sure that I should be justified in letting you make so great
a sacrifice for any one who has after all no claim upon
you."  And Paul got up from his seat and looked out of
the window, so that Isabel might not see his face.
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes grew wistful.  "Please don't stop me
now that at last I am trying to be good."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!  But the path of duty is not easy
walking, and I would carry you over the rough places if
I could; for the way is thorny and your feet are very
tender," replied Paul gently.
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless I am going."
</p>

<p>
"And I cannot help you, much as I should wish it.
If Joanna became much worse I should come out to her
once; but I could not afford the time to stay with her
long, as the unavoidable expenses of her illness will make
me specially busy all this winter."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless I am going," repeated Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"You have definitely made up your mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What does Lady Farley say about it?" asked Paul.
</p>

<p>
"She says I am old enough and wise enough to
please myself, and to know my own business best."
</p>

<p>
"Then, if your decision is now made and my words
are powerless to affect you one way or another, I may
tell you what this act of yours means to me and to my
people.  It will probably be the saving of Joanna's
life&mdash;at any rate it is giving her the one chance she has of
recovery; and without you this one chance would have
been denied her.  After I have told you this, all
expressions of gratitude would be superfluous, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; please don't thank me; I don't want to be
thanked," said Isabel breathlessly, "let us make all the
necessary arrangements; for Joanna and I ought to be
starting soon, if this foggy weather continues."
</p>

<p>
So Paul and Isabel set to work to plan poor Joanna's
exodus out of England before the winter actually set in;
and three weeks after this interview Isabel and Joanna
went out to Davos Platz together, with the former's
faithful old nurse to take care of and look after them.
</p>

<p>
The new life was very interesting to Isabel.  She had
hitherto lived in a world where sickness and death were
put out of sight and forgotten as far as possible; but
now she was suddenly plunged into the midst of a society
of people who were all either ill or anxious.  But these
bore it bravely, and put on a cheerful courage; and if she
had not known that all was not well with them, she would
have found them pretty much the same as happier folks.
</p>

<p>
Joanna specially interested Isabel, and the two women
were drawn very close together.  Neither had ever had
a sister; and a woman who has never had a sister has
missed something which can never be made up to her
in this world.  Women who have no sisters share their
confidences with their friends or their sisters-in-law,
just as men who have no legs walk about on cork or
wooden ones; but perfect satisfaction is not found in
makeshifts.  However anything is better than nothing;
so Isabel and Joanna found much pleasure in each
other's society.
</p>

<p>
Joanna did not talk much about herself; but when
she did, it was with perfect ease and cheerfulness.  She
had been brought up in a circle where the things which
are seen and temporal are not more familiar or real than
the things which are unseen and eternal; and this
familiarity and sense of nearness is of good comfort to
such souls as feel forebodings of the chill and the
darkness of the great Shadow.
</p>

<p>
"I minded dreadfully being ill at first," she said one
day to Isabel, after they had been some weeks together,
and their friendship was established, "I had meant to
do so much work for God&mdash;in my own little world I
really was doing it&mdash;and it seemed rather hard to be
suddenly put by on the shelf as of no further use.  I was
actually getting so conceited that I thought none of the
classes or meetings in Chayford would get on properly
without me; and yet mother says in her last letter that
my Bible-class has increased in numbers since Miss
Dallicot became the leader in my place, while the
Dorcas-meeting is doing more work than ever.  As for my
district, Alice Martin took it; and the people simply
adore her, she is so sweet and pretty and can speak to
them so beautifully.  So the Lord can carry on His work
without my help, though at one time I doubted it."  And
Joanna laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I did not know that Alice was good at work of that kind."
</p>

<p>
"She is; she is simply splendid.  In the first place
she is very pretty, and that has a tremendous influence.
It would take me twenty visits to the poor to win as
much love as she gains in one."
</p>

<p>
"But I did not know she was so religious."
</p>

<p>
"She was always good and amiable," replied Joanna,
"even when she was quite a child.  But lately she has
been a great deal under Edgar Ford's influence, and has
learnt from him the importance of our responsibility to
the poor.  She will do more good in my district than I
have ever done."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the world could do without any of us,"
said Isabel sadly, "none of us are indispensable to
anything or anybody."
</p>

<p>
Joanna shook her head.  "The world might, but God
couldn't."
</p>

<p>
"But you said that He could."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, I didn't.  I said that He could carry on
His work without us, which is quite a different thing."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked puzzled.  "What is the difference?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see? it is like this.  When I was a little
girl, father always allowed me to open all his letters with
a small paper-knife.  I used to love doing it, I felt so
important, and I imagined that if it hadn't been for me,
father's letters would have permanently remained
unopened.  I used to say nearly every day, 'You couldn't do
without me, could you, father?' and he always answered,
'No'.  Of course father could have opened all his letters
well enough without my help, but he couldn't have done
without me all the same."
</p>

<p>
"How good you are, dear Joanna!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I am not&mdash;I only wish I were; but I am ill,
and when one is ill one has plenty of time to think.
And I have come to the conclusion that God knows
His own business best, and that He must often smile
at us tenderly when He sees us so ready to help Him
with our advice.  He knows everything, and He says
that a certain thing will be best for us; we know next to
nothing, and yet, like Beatrice, we are 'at Him upon our
knees every morning and evening,' to prove to Him that
He is mistaken and that we know better.  It really is
rather humorous."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have learnt to leave everything to Him,
and not to worry?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope I have," replied Joanna.  "I don't deny that
it has been a difficult lesson.  At one time, like
everybody else, I thought that I knew better than God, and
I tried my utmost to teach Him what was the right thing
for me and for Methodism and for Christianity at large;
and I confess that I was grieved, not to say reproachful,
when He did not follow my advice.  But now I just sit
still, and let Him take all the responsibility."
</p>

<p>
"It must be very restful," sighed Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"It is.  If you went on a long voyage, it would be
very tiring to spend all your time in trying to steer the ship
by beating against the bulwarks with your hands, and
very ineffectual and foolish.  Then why behave thus
absurdly on the voyage of life?  For our Pilot never makes
mistakes."
</p>

<p>
It was not till the two friends became very intimate
that they began to talk about Paul, though they both
spent much time in thinking about him.  But at last
even that barrier of reserve gave way, as most barriers
do, if only a <i>tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte</i> be long enough, and Paul's sister
soon discovered that Isabel still loved Paul.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, why don't you ask him to come back to
you?" asked Joanna abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I couldn't&mdash;I should be ashamed, after the way
I have treated him."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you mean to let your pride spoil both your
life and his?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel did not answer, and Joanna continued: "When
people come to where I am now, they look at life so
differently from how they used to look when the end
of the road was not in sight; and they see that the things
which once seemed important are trivial, and the things
which once seemed trivial are the only things that
matter.  When you stand where I am standing, you
won't care a scrap whether your pride and your self-respect
received their due; but you will care infinitely
whether you and Paul are together, or whether you will
have to go down into the dark valley all alone."
</p>

<p>
Isabel began to cry quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry, Isabel; I am so sorry that I have upset
you, and I hate to talk in this horrid, depressing way.
But I felt I must tell you just once that, when the end
comes, you will find that nothing really matters except
the love of God and our love for each other; and I want
you to realize this before it is too late."
</p>

<p>
Isabel came and knelt down by Joanna's sofa.  "Do
you think that Paul could forgive me?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I should think so; there is nothing that real love
cannot forgive, and I am sure that Paul really loved
you."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know so much about love, Joanna?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell; I suppose every woman knows all about
it, whether she has tasted it or not.  That is one of the
things that I used to think I could teach the Lord;
I imagined that it was best for me&mdash;and for every
other woman&mdash;to live the ordinary woman's happy life.
But God knew better, and so love passed me by."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Joanna!"
</p>

<p>
Joanna rested her cheek against Isabel's.  "You
need not pity me now, dear; I have long ceased to mind,
though I did dreadfully at one time.  But when God
withholds a thing from us, He always gives us something
better in its place.  It is hard, I admit, to stand alone on
Pisgah, and to see the others going on without us into
the Promised Land; but Pisgah and its disappointment
are forgotten, after we have stood for a moment upon
the Mount of Transfiguration, and have caught glimpses
of the glory which shall be revealed."
</p>

<p>
After a moment's silence Isabel said softly: "I don't
believe there ever was anybody so good as you and
Paul."
</p>

<p>
"Paul is a good man; no one but father and mother
and I quite knows how good, I think."
</p>

<p>
"I do," whispered Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he gets angry sometimes," continued
Joanna, "and is stern and self-willed and masterful;
but he is very gentle and tender underneath, and
very unselfish.  There is only one thing he has ever done
which has really grieved me, and which seemed to me
to be inconsistent with the rest of his character; but I
suppose when men are very unhappy and bitter they do
things for which they are hardly accountable.  Still I
wish Paul had not written <i>Shams and Shadows</i>."
</p>

<p>
"He never did write it," cried Isabel, looking up
through her tears; "he was far too good and true and
noble to write such a nasty, sneering book as that.  He
could not have done it if he had tried!"
</p>

<p>
"Then if Paul didn't write it, who did?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> did," replied Isabel with a sob, "I was angry with
myself and therefore with everything else, and I wrote
that horrid book in a fit of temper.  And when I saw how
people hated it, I was ashamed, and felt I could not bear
the disgrace of being known as its author.  And then
Paul saved me from the consequences of my own folly,
and bore the punishment instead of me."

CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
As it was in the Beginning.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Sometimes mortals find the portals<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fairy-land;<br>
  And they straightway through the gateway<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter, hand in hand.<br>
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence; then Joanna said
gently, "And you doubted if he loved you after
this?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel only sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I am very glad you have told me," Joanna
continued, as she softly stroked Isabel's hair; "it is an
unspeakable joy to me to find that Paul never really fell
below himself after all.  But you mustn't tell any one
else; it is now Paul's secret and not yours."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I must; I must tell the whole world how good
Paul has been, and how vilely and cruelly it has
misjudged him."
</p>

<p>
"You must do nothing of the kind.  If Paul has
jeopardized his literary reputation to keep a secret, no
one has a right to tell that secret without his permission.
Don't you see how it is?  He has thought nothing in the
whole world of so much importance as the screening of
you; therefore it would be cruel indeed of you to undo
his life-work in a fit of hysterical conscientiousness."
</p>

<p>
"But it would serve me right for people to know how
horrid and selfish and cowardly I have been," cried
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Probably it would; but now I am considering what
is due to Paul, and not what is due to you, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Joanna, can you ever forgive me?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I couldn't have done so when I was
strong and well; but, as I told you, things are different
with me now.  Yes, I forgive you, Isabel; though I
confess it isn't in me to forgive as Paul forgives, nor
to love as Paul loves; but I cannot in the least
understand how either of you did what you have done&mdash;you
are both incomprehensible to me.  Tell me how it
happened."
</p>

<p>
"After I had quarrelled with Paul, I was in an awfully
bitter mood, because I thought he was hard and
cold and did not love me as I loved him.  I was ashamed
of caring for a man more than he cared for me, don't you
see?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I don't see, but never mind."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see that if a man gives his love unrequited,
he establishes at once a claim upon one woman's
gratitude and all women's sympathy; while if a woman
does the same thing, she is despised by one man and
derided by the rest?"
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't strike me in that light, but go on."
</p>

<p>
"Then it occurred to me that I would write a book
which should convince Paul that I was a shallow,
heartless woman of the world, and that I was incapable of
really loving him or any other man.  It was agony to my
pride to feel that perhaps Paul had only cared for me
because I was considered a good match; and I meant to turn
the tables on him, and wound his pride, by making him
believe that I had only been playing with him all the time
just to amuse myself."
</p>

<p>
"A severe punishment on Paul for the freaks of your
own imagination, my child!"
</p>

<p>
"All the time I was writing the book, I thought only
of him and of how I could manage to hurt him.  I did
not care a straw whether the novel were a success or not,
or whether anybody read it except Paul.  But when it
came out it made a hit, as you know, and everybody was
talking about it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I remember."
</p>

<p>
"Though people thought it clever they did not really
like it, and they said nasty things about the author."
</p>

<p>
Joanna nodded.  Nobody knew better than she did
the nasty things that had been said; yet she did not
remove her caressing hand from the bent head.
</p>

<p>
"And then," continued Isabel, "I was in a perfect
frenzy of fear lest they should find out that I had written
it, and should begin to look shy at me.  I cared so much
for approval and admiration, that I thought it would kill
me to be disapproved of as society disapproved of the
author of <i>Shams and Shadows</i>.  I used to lie awake at
night wondering whatever I could do to put people off
the scent."
</p>

<p>
"Well, and what happened then?"
</p>

<p>
"One day, when my terror was at its height, I heard
that Paul had told Lord Robert Thistletown that he had
taken the name of Angus Grey.  I saw in a flash what
that meant; it meant that the man, whom I had wounded
and insulted, understood better even than I did what a
disadvantage the authorship of <i>Shams and Shadows</i>
would be to me; and had therefore shielded me at the
expense of his own literary reputation, and had taken my
punishment upon himself."
</p>

<p>
Joanna's eyes were shining.  "It was a fine thing to do;
for Paul's literary reputation was no light matter to him."
</p>

<p>
"I know it wasn't; it was the best thing he had, and
he gave it up to save me."
</p>

<p>
That night Joanna lay awake, thinking over the strange
story she had heard.  "It must be wonderful to be loved
like that!" she said to herself.  And because nothing
this side heaven can quite stifle the cry of the human
heart for human love (if the human heart happen to be
a woman's) there were tears on Joanna's lashes when at
last she fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Isabel also lay awake that night, torn by the conflicting
emotions of love and pride.  And because, when these
two come into conflict, the result is a foregone conclusion,
she wrote the next day to Paul:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"MY DEAR PAUL,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Will you forgive me?  Not because I deserve it, but
because I love you.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours as you would,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ISABEL CARNABY."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then followed a season of great anguish of mind on
Isabel's part.  She now felt absolutely certain that Paul
no longer loved her, and would therefore humiliate her by
refusing his forgiveness; and she decided that she should
at once hide herself from the world in a sisterhood, and
spend the remainder of her disappointed days in
conventual seclusion.  She even went so far as to decide
that she should call herself "Sister Marah," because life
had proved so bitter to her.  Isabel was nothing if not
dramatic.
</p>

<p>
The answer to her letter came by telegraph:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"Expect me Thursday.&mdash;PAUL."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Isabel was alone when this telegram was brought to
her, and as she read it she flushed with joy.
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't wasted a minute," she said to herself.
"He must have started as soon as he had my letter, and
be travelling night and day without stopping."
</p>

<p>
Then she looked at her reflection in a mirror and
laughed softly, because she was still young and a man
loved her.  She was very human, even at her best.
</p>

<p>
But when Thursday came she was dreadfully frightened.
It was one thing to feel conscious of her power
over Paul while half a continent divided them, and quite
another to feel conscious of his power over her when she
was expecting to see him face to face every minute.
</p>

<p>
When at last he did arrive, Joanna went into the hall
to meet him; but Isabel was stricken with that paralyzing
form of shyness which so often seizes us when our heart's
desire is within our grasp, and makes us wish, for one
mad moment, to throw it away because we have longed
for it so passionately.  So she remained alone in the
salon and looked out of the window, and her knees felt as
if they were made of muslin, like the knees of dolls.  Then
some one opened the door and shut it behind him; and at
that her heart beat so violently that the very snow-clad
mountains outside began to tremble and shake as she
looked at them.  With a supreme effort she turned round,
and tried to repeat the appeal for forgiveness which she
had prepared; but she could not utter a word, because
Paul's arms were holding her fast; and there was no
need to utter a word, because she had seen Paul's face.
</p>

<p>
Life's attar-of-roses is as rare as it is precious, and it
takes the sunshine of many summers and the braving of
many thorns to produce a single drop.  But that drop,
when produced, is worth all that it cost, and the perfume
of it will last for ever.  So Paul and Isabel thought
during the next half-hour.
</p>

<p>
After the lovers had returned to earth, Isabel said:
"I shall now tell the whole world that I wrote that
horrid book, and that it has misjudged you all along;
and then every one will know how splendidly you have
behaved."
</p>

<p>
"You shall do nothing of the kind, sweetheart."  And
Paul kissed her again.
</p>

<p>
"But I must.  I could not bear for you to bear the
blame any longer."
</p>

<p>
"Still, you will have to bear it, my darling.  I
could not bear any one to have it in his power to blame
you, and I must have my own way this time."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't fair."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help that I can stand it very well when
people say things against me, but I could not stand it at
all if people said things against you; so I am acting from
purely selfish motives when I say that the secret must
always be kept for my sake."
</p>

<p>
"But, Paul, how can I show my gratitude to you, and
my penitence?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply by doing what I ask, and by giving no one
any excuse for finding fault with my wife."
</p>

<p>
"It was a horrid book," said Isabel sadly.
</p>

<p>
"I know it was, dear heart, but you did not mean a
word of it, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I wrote it in a temper&mdash;a vile, hateful, disgusting
temper."
</p>

<p>
"I know you did; but the world might not understand
this as well as I do, and therefore might misjudge you;
and the world shall not have the chance."
</p>

<p>
"I really was frightfully angry with you," said Isabel,
now revelling in the contemplation of dangers past, "I
used to rack my brains for things that I could write to
vex you."
</p>

<p>
"When did you begin to love me again?" queried Paul.
</p>

<p>
Isabel pondered for a moment.  "I think I really
must have loved you all the time, or else I could not
have hated you so."
</p>

<p>
Paul laughed.  Life had been so serious to him of
late that it was delightful to hear a woman talk nonsense
again.
</p>

<p>
"And will you go on loving me always?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be able to help it; when I once care for any
one I am like a five-pound note on Sundays&mdash;there is no
possibility of changing me."
</p>

<p>
"My dear one, how sweet you are!"
</p>

<p>
"How did you find out that I was the author?" asked
Isabel, trying to tie a knot in Paul's watch-chain.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it at once; I also knew that you had written
it to hurt me; and, what is more, that you had succeeded
beyond your wildest expectations."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Paul!  Did it make you very angry?"
</p>

<p>
"Not angry; but I confess it hurt me more than I
had believed I was capable of being hurt.  But I soon
forgot this in my fear of the secret's coming out as to
who was the author, and my knowledge of how much the
disclosure of this secret would hurt you."
</p>

<p>
"And then you decided to pretend that you had written it?"
</p>

<p>
"It seemed to me the only thing to do to ensure
your permanent safety; as, when people once know a
thing, they naturally cease to speculate about it; and they
had already come to the conclusion that the book must
have been written by some one in your set.  Of course I
knew that your publishers any day might show up my
false pretences and disgrace me in the eyes of the world,
which would never believe in the purity of my motives,
but would condemn me as an arrant impostor to the end
of the chapter.  But I also knew that your publishers
would not do this without permission from you; and,
angry as you were with me, I did not think you would
deal me this final and irrevocable blow, because I felt
sure you would understand my reasons, and would know
that I had done this somewhat doubtful action solely out
of consideration for you."
</p>

<p>
"I understood this at once."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would," Paul continued, "but, you see,
dear, other people might not have done so; and they
might have fancied I was no better than a literary thief,
trading upon a reputation which really was not mine."
</p>

<p>
Isabel was silent for a moment; then she said: "I
told Joanna; I could not help it."
</p>

<p>
Paul's face fell; he could not bear to feel that even
his sister should have the right to sit in judgment upon
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"And you must also tell your father and mother,"
persisted Isabel, "I could not be happy if I felt that
they still misunderstood you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that."
</p>

<p>
"But I do.  If you will give way to me just in this, I
will do what you want about everything else; and no one
but your own people shall ever know that I wrote <i>Shams
and Shadows</i>."
</p>

<p>
And Paul reluctantly consented.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Shams and Shadows</i> made a lot of money," said
Isabel, "but I could not touch a penny of it.  I hated it
so much that I gave it all to charity."
</p>

<p>
Paul could not help laughing.  "A somewhat strange
reason, dear heart, but by no means an uncommon one,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Then followed a very happy week.  Paul and Isabel
were naturally in a state of bliss; and Joanna rejoiced
too&mdash;and on her own account&mdash;for the doctors told her
that the air of Davos had done for her all that they had
hoped and far more than they had expected; and assured
her that she would get quite strong and well again.  And
this fact doubled the happiness of the other two: for
Paul loved his sister very dearly; and Isabel's heart was
filled with thanksgiving to feel that she had been allowed
to be, in a measure, the means of Joanna's recovery, and
so had done something for Paul in return for all that he
had done for her.
</p>

<p>
But Paul could not stay with them for more than a
week, so he went back to his work, promising to return
for Joanna and Isabel when spring returned to England.
</p>

<p>
When he had been back in London for about three
weeks his father wrote to tell him that Miss Dallicot was
very ill, and had expressed a great wish to see the
minister's son once more.  So Paul ran down home for a day
or two.
</p>

<p>
Things were brighter at the Cottage than they had
been for some time, for Mrs. Seaton began to gain
strength as soon as she heard that all was well with her
children, and that health had returned to Joanna and
happiness to Paul; and her husband felt better and
younger because she did.
</p>

<p>
Paul had written to tell his mother that all was right
again between himself and Isabel.  He gave no explanations,
nor did Mrs. Seaton require any: for she was wise
enough to know that if people love each other, explanations
are never needed; and if they don't love each other,
no explanations will mend matters.
</p>

<p>
When Paul went to see Miss Dallicot he found her
extremely weak, and shrivelled up into a little raisin of a
woman.  But her diction was as choice as ever.
</p>

<p>
"It is unspeakably gratifying to me to see your countenance
once again, my dear young friend," she began, "and
excessively kind of you to snatch a brief moment from the
busy round of your incessant and onerous duties, to give
such pleasure to an infirm and aged woman, who perhaps
overstepped the rights of friendship in putting you to such
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, Miss Drusilla.  I am awfully glad to see
you again, and I only wish that I could see you looking
better."
</p>

<p>
"That, my dear Paul, is a wish which can never be
fulfilled in this world.  But the young should not be made
gloomy by the contemplation of sombre and serious subjects;
therefore let us divert our thoughts into a more
invigorating and cheering channel."
</p>

<p>
So Paul told the old lady about Isabel and Joanna
and their life at Davos, and about his work in London,
and his hope that he and Isabel would be married some
time during the year then beginning; while Miss Drusilla
listened with the greatest interest, and made her usual
long-winded comments.
</p>

<p>
At last she said, "I feel that I owe it to you, my dear
young friend, to offer some explanation of the fact of my
so specially desiring to see your face once more, and of
my venturing to put you to the trouble and fatigue of a
journey from London, by the oracular expression of this
desire on my part."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pleasure rather than a trouble," said Paul
kindly, "it was very good of you to want to see me
and I was very pleased to come."  But all the same
he really was surprised, as naturally Miss Dallicot had
never been a special friend of his.
</p>

<p>
"The fact of the matter is," continued the little
spinster, "you bear a strong facial resemblance to some one
for whom I entertained a warm regard a considerable
number of years ago.  I daresay to your sound and
vigorous judgment an accidental physical likeness appears
a somewhat unsound basis for interest or attachment;
but the fact remains that it does form such a basis
in my case, though I should agree with you that from an
intellectual standpoint the position is untenable."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I can understand as much as that; for actually
I once held a poor woman's baby for her while she
scrambled up to the top of a London omnibus&mdash;and an
extremely unattractive and unfanciable little brat it
was&mdash;simply because the woman looked tired, and her eyes
reminded me of Isabel's."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, how very interesting!  I trust that you
informed Miss Carnaby of this somewhat romantic incident,
as it would surely have proved most gratifying to her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, it wouldn't; she would have been dreadfully
hurt at being considered to resemble the middle-aged wife
of an impecunious artisan.  Women are never pleased at
being thought like anybody who isn't well dressed, I have
discovered.  I remember Isabel was quite angry once
when I showed her a peasant girl by Greuze, and said it
reminded me of her; and she told me that if I'd said she
was like a fashion-plate she should have been far better
pleased&mdash;and she really would," added Paul, laughing at
the remembrance.
</p>

<p>
"The feminine mind has certainly some strange
inconsistencies," murmured Miss Drusilla, unconsciously
straightening her cap.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it has; that is why it is so fascinating.  I
would not give a fig for a woman who had no bewitching
little vanities.  And the funny thing is that they are not
vain of the things which really are a credit to them, but
of the things which are a credit to their dressmakers.
Now, take Isabel; she is awfully pleased with herself
when she has got a new frock on, but she never knows
that it is her figure which makes the frock look so well;
and she thinks far more about the colour of her gowns
than about the colour of her eyes."
</p>

<p>
(But here Paul was mistaken.)
</p>

<p>
"I should have imagined that men, with their robuster
minds and sounder common sense, would have despised
such small vanities as these," remarked Miss Dallicot.
</p>

<p>
"Not we; we like them."
</p>

<p>
"I always used to think that a profound and scholarly
mind would not find happiness apart from profound and
scholarly companionship, and would experience an
extreme distaste for what I might call foolish and frivolous
society.  But I learnt afterwards that these views of
mine were incorrect."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid they were."
</p>

<p>
A far-away look came into Miss Drusilla's faded eyes;
her thoughts had gone back to the long-ago.
</p>

<p>
"When I was comparatively young," she said dreamily,
"I was honoured by the friendship of a most cultured and
accomplished man.  He was a great scholar; and under
his tuition I made myself proficient in both Greek and
Latin.  It is true that I loved learning for its own sake,
but I loved it still better for his; and I worked long and late
in order to render myself more fit for his companionship
and more congenial to his taste.  As you will perceive, I
felt it only natural that so profound a mind should shrink
from the society of the flippant and the unlearned."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Paul, and his voice was very tender.
</p>

<p>
"My friend's profession was tutorial," continued Miss
Dallicot, "and in later life he became the headmaster of
one of our great public schools.  He and I were so intimately
acquainted that I speculated much as to his future;
and I felt sure that&mdash;if he ever did enter the holy estate
of matrimony&mdash;he would naturally require a helpmeet
who could assist him in the fulfilment of his scholastic
duties, and accompany him in his ceaseless pursuit after
knowledge."
</p>

<p>
Paul felt very pitiful; the world is so full of sad
little mistakes like this, which are too pathetic to be
comedies and too commonplace to be tragedies.
</p>

<p>
"Did you study very hard?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I did.  I overcame the difficulties of the
Greek and Latin tongues with amazing rapidity&mdash;at least
so my dear master said; and he counted me his most
successful pupil."
</p>

<p>
"And then?" said Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Then it happened that a young lady came to pay a
lengthy visit to friends in our neighbourhood.  She was
well born, and possessed considerable personal charm;
but her ignorance was something appalling.  I recall that
she once asked, before a room full of people, whether
Homer wrote Greek or Latin, and if CÃ¦sar were a
poet."  And Miss Dallicot fairly shuddered.
</p>

<p>
Paul could not forbear smiling, Miss Drusilla was so
intensely shocked at the mere memory of these atrocities.
</p>

<p>
"Yet in spite of all this," continued Miss Dallicot,
"my friend married her.  Why he did so was always
incomprehensible to me, as they two could not have had a
single idea or interest in common.  Yet he did it.  I shall
never forget a visit I once paid to them not long after
their marriage.  She endeavoured to make use of a Latin
quotation, and actually&mdash;yes, actually, my dear Paul&mdash;she
made a false quantity; and she the wife of a headmaster!"
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" said Paul; "what ever did the
bridegroom do?"
</p>

<p>
"It was then that he showed the marvellous nobility
and patience which always struck me so much in my
contemplation of his character.  I realized what he must
have suffered, as a false quantity was always torture to
his cultivated and sensitive ear; if one of his boys were
guilty of such a thing, he straightway chastised the
offender; when I made a false quantity, he blamed me
severely, and said that his nerves could not stand it."
</p>

<p>
"Then what did he do to his bride?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, his amiability was something marvellous.
I was so grieved for him&mdash;so ashamed&mdash;that I could
scarcely look up; but he rose to the occasion.  He said
not one single word of reproof&mdash;though I knew that many
were burning upon his tongue&mdash;but he just laughed, and
went up to his wife and kissed her.  Did you ever hear
of an instance of more heroic self-restraint?"
</p>

<p>
Paul thought that he had, but he did not say so.  He
sympathized with Miss Drusilla; but he also sympathized
with the headmaster.
</p>

<p>
"Did she seem very much ashamed?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  That was the most painful part of that
most painful scene.  The careless young thing was as
callous as she was illiterate.  She merely laughed, as if
it were nothing more than a joke, and called my dear
friend 'a silly boy'.  It struck me, and it strikes me still,
as a most unseemly epithet for any right-minded woman
to apply to her husband, especially when he was a man
of between thirty and forty years of age, and one of the
greatest Greek scholars of his day."
</p>

<p>
"Where is your friend now?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Dallicot sighed.  "I grieve to say that his
earthly career was closed some years ago.  His wife was
taken first, and he survived her only for the space of a
few months.  Some persons, not intimately acquainted
with the parties concerned, said that his death was due
to sorrow for hers; but I think this statement must have
been incorrect, as so uneducated and frivolous a woman
could never have been a thoroughly congenial companion
to so erudite and wise a man.  Therefore I conjecture
that the approximation in the respective dates of his and
her demise was merely a coincidence."
</p>

<p>
Paul did not feel so sure of this; he could imagine
that a world depopulated of Isabel would be quite too
desolate for human habitation.  But all he said was: "It
is an interesting little story."
</p>

<p>
So it was; but the interesting part of it was the part
that poor little Miss Dallicot was incapable of seeing.
People who tell us a story often tell far more than they
intend, and, in fact, far more than they themselves know.
They open the door that we may have a peep into their
back-garden, and they have no idea that to us that peep
includes a distant and extensive view, which their
shortsighted eyes have never beheld.
</p>

<p>
"My friend was a most fascinating individual,"
continued Miss Drusilla dreamily, "endowed with unusual
natural gifts, which were perfected by most assiduous
study.  He was withal the most modest man I have ever
met.  In person, my dear Paul, you strongly resemble
him; it seems, perchance, strange for so trifling a detail
to remain in one's mind for a period of over forty years,
yet I can still vividly recall the colour of his hair, which
was precisely of the same shade as yours."
</p>

<p>
Then Paul said good-bye to the little spinster, as she
was growing too tired to talk any more.  And he never
saw her again.
</p>

<p>
A fortnight after his visit to Chayford Miss Drusilla
died, and when her will came to be read it was found that
she had left her entire fortune&mdash;amounting to some
thirty thousand pounds&mdash;to Paul Seaton.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
For Conscience' Sake.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I hear a call through the silver night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the golden day,<br>
  "Go forth and work, for the fields are white!"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I dare not disobey.<br>
</p>

<p>
It was during the winter which Joanna spent at Davos,
that Edgar Ford screwed his courage to the sticking
point sufficiently to ask Alice Martin to become
his wife.
</p>

<p>
By this time Alice's views of life had completely
changed.  She had not only forgotten that she had ever
loved Paul&mdash;a comparatively trifling feat; she had not
only fallen in love with some one else&mdash;an accomplishment
likewise not difficult of feminine attainment; but
she had succeeded in putting Edgar so completely in
Paul's place that the change was retrospective, and
Edgar was actually the richer for Alice's former devotion
to Paul.
</p>

<p>
She had not blotted out the sum of her old love&mdash;she
had merely transferred it from Paul's account to Edgar's;
which was a decidedly wiser plan, as thus no good
material was wasted.  All the dreams of her springtime
and the romance of her early summer, now went to the
making of a rich harvest of affection for Edgar Ford to
reap.  Alice was one of the women who cannot live
without loving; the man that such a woman happens to
love is a mere matter of detail.
</p>

<p>
To an artist his art is everything, and it is born in
him; the masters, under whom he studies, can only
teach him style and manner and the tricks of his craft.
In after life the pupil may learn in other schools, but
he will always be a better artist because of the education
which he received from the teachers who first trained
him.  Thus it is with women of the type of Alice
Martin.  The power of loving is part of themselves, and
nothing can crush that out of them.  They may learn
technique from the master under whom they first study;
but if in later days they turn to other teachers, that
particular instructor will be forgotten, though they will
always be able to love better because of the education
which they received from him.
</p>

<p>
It may be true that "over the past not heaven itself
has power"; but in this respect, if it be so, certain
women have the advantage of heaven&mdash;at least as far
as their own feelings are concerned.  They can recolour
the past so as to make it a becoming background for
the present, just as we can repaper our drawing-rooms
when we buy new furniture; and they can change the
cast of their little dramas, long after the play has been
played and the lights turned out.
</p>

<p>
The conies are a feeble folk; but their strength lies
in their power to make use of the rock so as to meet their
own requirements.
</p>

<p>
It was a better thing for Alice to love Edgar than it
had ever been to love Paul, because Edgar was suited to
her and Paul was not.  A woman can always adapt
herself to the man she loves, and be&mdash;for as long as she
chooses&mdash;the sort of woman that he approves; but,
though it is not difficult for a woman to be somebody
else instead of herself for a time, it becomes fatiguing
if kept up for too long.  After a while it feels like
walking in boots which are a shade too short, or biting crusts
when one has the toothache.
</p>

<p>
It was a source of keen delight to Edgar that Alice
shared his socialistic views with respect to the sanctity
of the individual and the wrongfulness of riches; he did
not know that she would have agreed with him just the
same had he preached the subjugation of the masses
and the divine right of kings.
</p>

<p>
"Alice, do you think you could ever love me?" Edgar
asked suddenly one day, when they two were practising
duets together.
</p>

<p>
"I think I have always loved you," she answered softly.
</p>

<p>
This was no untruth.  Alice had always loved the
hero of the piece; that Paul had been for a time Edgar's
understudy in the part, had no practical bearing on the
case.
</p>

<p>
"Then will you be my wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Edgar wanted to kiss Alice, but he refrained for fear
of frightening her.  Alice wanted Edgar to kiss her, and
could not imagine why he did not do so.  It was in things
like this that Edgar made mistakes.  He had never learnt
that nine times out of ten other people want the same
things as we do; and if they don't, it doesn't so very
much matter, as long as we get our own way.
</p>

<p>
"I do not wish to deceive you," he said, "or to win
your love under false pretences, though that love is the
desire of my heart.  But my wife will have no luxury,
though the world counts me a rich man."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want luxury," replied Alice, "I only want you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say you dare face a life of toil and
poverty for my sake?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do.  Don't you understand that I care
for nothing but being with you, and feeling that you are
pleased with me?"
</p>

<p>
Then Edgar took her in his arms and kissed her, and
Alice's cup of bliss was full.
</p>

<p>
"You know my views about money," Edgar said,
"and that I hold it a sin for any man to live a life of ease
and pleasure while his fellow-men are starving.  Well, I
simply cannot go on any longer living my present life,
when I know of the sea of sin and suffering and sorrow
all around me.  I feel I must go down into the midst of
it, and do something for those weaker brethren for whom
Christ died."
</p>

<p>
Alice's beautiful face was aglow with excitement:
"I will come down with you, and stand by your side.  I
think it is splendid of you to give up everything for the
sake of the poor; and I am proud to be the woman you
have chosen to help you to bear this burden and to take
up this cross!"
</p>

<p>
"My darling! do you think you can be quite happy
without horses and carriages and all the external
trappings of wealth?"
</p>

<p>
"I should rather think I could!  I don't care a bit
about things like that.  Mamma thinks they are
important, but they have always bothered me ever since I
was a little girl and used to think it a treat to walk out
to tea instead of having the carriage."
</p>

<p>
"But you will be a rich woman on your own account,
Alice, and you must do what you will with your own."
</p>

<p>
"I shall give it all to you to do whatever you like
with, and it will help us to help others all the more."
</p>

<p>
"Then will you come and live with me down at the
Stepney Settlement, in connection with Hampden House,
and take your part in the work there?" asked Edgar.
"It is a grand field for labour, and the labourers are as
yet few."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will.  I will go anywhere with you and
do anything for you as long as I live."
</p>

<p>
"My brave little girl!"
</p>

<p>
Alice slipped her hand into his.  "And I will always
act as you bid me and obey you in everything, if only
you'll promise never, never to be cross with me.  I
think it would kill me if ever you were vexed with me;
so you won't be, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I?&mdash;vexed with you?  My dearest, the thing is unthinkable."
</p>

<p>
"Then I don't care what happens," said Alice
contentedly.  "But you were once awfully cross with me,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"My child, what on earth do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it was one time&mdash;ages and ages ago&mdash;when
you never would speak to me if you could help it, and
it used to make me so miserable.  You really were cross
then."  And Alice's disengaged hand wandered idly over
the keys.
</p>

<p>
"Not cross, dear; only very, very unhappy, because
I loved you and I did not think you would ever love me."
</p>

<p>
Alice raised her pretty eyebrows.  "Well, that was
hardly the way to make me love you, was it?  It wasn't
likely that I should fall in love with a man in a temper&mdash;at
least I mean to say with a man who looked as if he
were in a temper."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you would have loved me then, Alice,
if you had known that all my outside sternness was merely
the mask I put on to hide my love for you?  Tell me,
dear, I want to know."
</p>

<p>
Alice thought for a moment.  "I expect I should,
for I have always adored the shape of your nose."
</p>

<p>
Edgar laughed, and Alice went on: "I used to be
afraid that I bored you because I wasn't clever; but
now you don't mind my not being clever a bit, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"My darling, I hate clever women; a woman is
meant to be beautiful and good, and cleverness simply
spoils her."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't you admire Isabel Carnaby?"
</p>

<p>
(Alice was still a woman, though she was ready to go
down and live in the Stepney Settlement.)
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't exactly say that I don't admire her; she
is so modern and up-to-date, that I regard her as a sort
of national institution that one ought to feel proud
of&mdash;a specimen of what the nineteenth century can
produce.  But she never attracts me in the least; she is
cold and brilliant and hard, like a diamond, and has
nothing lovable about her, as far as I can see."
</p>

<p>
Alice drew a little contented sigh.  "And she isn't
really pretty, is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  I never can bear blue eyes; they are
always cold and unsympathetic, I think."
</p>

<p>
"What coloured eyes do you like best?"
</p>

<p>
"Brown&mdash;like velvet; and hair to match and a
complexion like a rose-leaf."
</p>

<p>
Alice laughed a low happy laugh.  "I am so glad you
don't mind my being stupid."
</p>

<p>
"You are not stupid, dear; you are full of tact&mdash;which
is infinitely better than cleverness.  See how well
you can talk to the poor, and how you can make them
love you.  You have a happy knack of always saying the
the right thing."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad.  You don't know how hard I try to
be the sort of woman that you approve of; I am always
thinking of you, and of what I can do or say to please
you."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Alice!" said Edgar tenderly, "you overpower
me with the feeling that I can never do enough to deserve
all this love."
</p>

<p>
"No, Edgar; it is I who ought to be grateful, because
whatever niceness there is in me is all your doing.  It
is you who have moulded my character and formed my
opinions; so that whatever good I may do in this world
must be put down to your credit and not mine."
</p>

<p>
Which was quite true; and Edgar had every reason
to be proud of his handiwork.
</p>

<p>
There was joy at The Cedars because of Alice's
engagement to Edgar Ford.  Mrs. Martin fairly beamed.
She felt that Providence had had a hand in the matter&mdash;which
was perfectly true; nevertheless when Providence
had seemed to be bringing about a union between her
daughter and Paul Seaton, Mrs. Martin, like a troublesome
politician, was not willing to "serve under" the Leader in
power.  In this respect she was by no means singular;
we are all naturally more submissive to the decrees of
heaven when those decrees are in accordance with our
own desires.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said to her daughter, "I am sure you
will be very happy, because a woman naturally requires
one stronger than herself to lean upon; and, besides,
Edgar is an only son, so that whatever his parents have
to leave will come to him."
</p>

<p>
"I could never have been happy as an old maid,
mamma; the feeling that nobody needed me or cared for
me would have killed me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin stitched at her bazaar-work with a
complacent smile: "I know it would, love; you have such a
very affectionate nature.  And it is difficult for a single
woman to take any social position, unless she is a lady of
title."
</p>

<p>
Alice listened dutifully, and her mother rambled on:
"It will be so nice for you, dear, when Edgar goes into
Parliament; for I hear that members of Parliament and
their wives are received in the highest circles.  It is a
pity dear Edgar isn't a Conservative&mdash;there is always
such refinement about Conservatives&mdash;but that cannot
be helped, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! mamma, Edgar would never become a Conservative."
</p>

<p>
"I am not suggesting that he should, my love; but
perhaps in time you might persuade him to become an
old-fashioned Whig; and that, I believe, is almost as
aristocratic.  Still I cannot help wishing that he had
been a Conservative in the first instance; you see, a
Radical may be a gentleman, but a Conservative must be
one."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you, love?  Well, I can hardly explain it to
you, but I have a feeling that it is more correct to be a
Conservative."
</p>

<p>
"But I could not try to make Edgar go against his
own convictions, mamma."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin paused for a moment while she selected
a fresh thread of silk; then she said: "Ah! my love, if
you want to get on in society, you must think more
about conventions than convictions.  And since Edgar
persists in remaining a Radical, I would ignore it if I
were you."
</p>

<p>
"But there is nothing to be ashamed of in one's
politics," persisted Alice; "men have a right to think
what they like."
</p>

<p>
"Still, my dear, if one espoused the cause of the
people, it might lead to the impression that one had risen
from the people; and that would be extremely painful to
any one, especially to a person with my sensitive feelings."
</p>

<p>
Alice however was obstinate; it was her one fault and
she freely indulged in it.  "We are risen from the
people," she said; "that is merely the truth."
</p>

<p>
Her mother sighed, as she threaded her needle.
"When you have lived as long as I have, my dear, you
will find that the truth is generally vulgar and invariably
inexpedient."
</p>

<p>
"Edgar and I don't mean to behave like rich people,
or to go in for society, but to live among the poor and try
to help them."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin smiled indulgently.  "Young men often
get strange, socialistic notions like that into their heads,
but a few drops of nitre on a lump of sugar soon put them
all right again."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to put Edgar all right as you call
it, mamma; the reason why I love him so dearly is that
he is so good and unworldly and has such high ideals."
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, he will be all right when he is married.
My experience is that there is nothing like getting
married for curing young men of ideals and nonsense
of that kind.  Your dear papa never bothered his head
about ideals after he had married me."
</p>

<p>
"Edgar says the truth is stronger than everything,
and that the height of good breeding is never to be
ashamed of anything," persisted Alice, whose "strength
was as the strength of ten" when she had "Edgar says"
to back up her opinions.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, I am double Edgar's age, and I have
learnt that bare facts, like everything else, require
clothing; and that the more becoming the clothing, the
more effective the facts."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Martin had learnt a great deal during the last ten
years.  She had got on in the world, and the world had
taught her much and found her an apt pupil.  It is the
world's business to cover its vessels with the very best
electro-plate; this is all that it undertakes to do, and it
never pretends to be a depot for hall-marked articles.
If we give ourselves up to the world's hardening process,
and duly worship rank and wealth and success and all
other licensed gods, it will hide our weaknesses under
its elegant electro covering, and we shall shine for a while
like burnished silver.  But the real metal is found
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of the year the long-expected Dissolution
was announced.  Excitement ran high all
through the country as the general election approached;
and Michael Ford was full of delight to think that at last
he should see his life's ambition realized, and his son a
member of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
But when he mentioned the subject to that son,
Edgar&mdash;for the first time in his life&mdash;was not amenable
to his father's wishes.
</p>

<p>
"I am more sorry than I can ever say to disappoint
you, but I cannot stand at this election," he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford was dumfounded.  "My dear boy, what on
earth do you mean?  You have plenty of money, and no
business cares to occupy your time and attention; and
at Chayford the thing will be simply a walk-over."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't that I am afraid of not getting in&mdash;it is
something quite different from that.  If I thought it
right to stand, no amount of opposition would deter me."
</p>

<p>
"Then what is it?  If you think that your views are
too advanced to please me, you need have no further
hesitation on that score.  I have long ago learnt that the
ways of old folks are too slow for the younger generation,
and that we must be content to let the stream flow on as
quickly as it will, and not attempt to let or hinder it."
</p>

<p>
Edgar longed to spare his father the pain which he
felt bound to inflict; but this was impossible.  He had
dallied long enough, and now the time had come to speak
out.
</p>

<p>
"I have made up my mind, and nothing now can alter
me," he began, and his face was very white, "for a long
time my duty to you has been in conflict with the duty
which I owe to a higher Power; but now a crisis has
come, and I feel I must hesitate no longer."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford did not speak, so Edgar went on: "I do not
feel it right for me to be living in luxury while so many
of my fellow-men are perishing with hunger; I do not
feel it right for me to be living in idleness while so many
of my brethren cry out for help.  The call has come for
me to go out into the highways and hedges and compel
all that are bidden to come in to the feast; and it is a
call which may not be disobeyed."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Edgar, did it never occur to you that
you might serve God and your generation more effectually
as an influential statesman than as an hysterical
socialist?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford's voice was hard and dry, but Edgar's face
was alight with an enthusiasm which no worldly wisdom
could quench.
</p>

<p>
"My dear father, you know as well as I do that it is
not in me to become a statesman, or even an ordinary
politician.  I could never merge myself in my party, or
content myself with compromises; I should always be
fighting little battles of my own, and tilting at windmills
which nobody but myself could see.  I do not belong to
any party; I have too many fads and scruples to identify
myself with any political school.  Therefore I should not
be justified in asking any constituency to return me as
its member.  It would be unfair to my constituents and
unfair to myself."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford played with a paper-knife, but he did not say
anything.  What was the use?
</p>

<p>
"I do not deny," Edgar continued, "that a politician
is called to do a great and necessary work; I merely say
that I am not called upon to be a politician.  Oh! father,
do not tempt me.  I know all the arguments that you
would use, and I have tried in vain to stifle my own
conscience with them over and over again.  I have lived an
upright and honourable life&mdash;but that is not enough; I
have kept my heart pure and my hands clean&mdash;but that
is not enough; through it all I can hear one Voice
speaking: 'Sell all thou hast and give to the poor'.
And dare I turn away because I have great possessions?"
</p>

<p>
Michael Ford sighed heavily, but still he did not
speak.  His face looked ten years older than it had looked
ten minutes ago.
</p>

<p>
"It cuts me to the heart to hurt you like this after
all that you have done for me," continued Edgar, and
his voice trembled, "but I see my way plain before my
face, and I dare not turn aside; 'for he that loveth father
or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me'."
</p>

<p>
"Then what do you intend to do?" asked Mr. Ford
wearily, looking across his writing-table at the young man
standing by the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
"I intend to join the Hampden House Settlement at
Stepney, and to live with the poor and for the poor; and
I hope to spend the rest of my life in trying to comfort
broken hearts and to brighten darkened homes.  I have
closed my ears to the cry of suffering humanity long
enough&mdash;too long, alas!&mdash;but at last they have been
opened; and after <i>Ephphatha</i> has once been pronounced,
a man cannot but listen to the cries of his fellows and to
the commands of his God."
</p>

<p>
"What does Alice say to all this?"
</p>

<p>
The mention of Alice's name gave her lover fresh
courage.
</p>

<p>
"She agrees with me in all my decisions," he said,
"and she is ready to share in all my efforts; in fact, it
is her enthusiasm which has inspired and sustained me,
and has renewed my strength when I felt ready to fall."
</p>

<p>
"Are you aware that both you and Alice will each
have a very large fortune of your own some day?"
Mr. Ford asked drily.
</p>

<p>
"Is any fortune too large to give to God?" was
Edgar's response.
</p>

<p>
Michael Ford saw that the case was hopeless; therefore
he wasted no more time in discussing it.  He knew
that it is possible, by means of argument, to convince a
man's judgment and even to overcome his prejudices; but
arguing against a man's conscience is sorry work&mdash;ninety-nine
times out of a hundred it meets with no success;
and the hundredth entails a responsibility which is harder
to bear than failure.
</p>

<p>
When Edgar left him, Mr. Ford sat for a while buried
in thought.  "It is the way of the world," he said to
himself; "one man is born to wealth and power and
success, and he flings them all away; another man has
everything against him, and he climbs to the top of the
tree.  The son of the rich man serves, while the son of
the poor man sits down to meat; and one man labours,
in order that another man's son may enter into his
labours.  Certainly Fate has a sense of humour."
</p>

<p>
Then he took up his pen and wrote to Paul Seaton.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
The Election.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  They fought all day with might and main;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the sun was set<br>
  The victors longed to fight again&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanquished, to forget.<br>
</p>

<p>
Paul Seaton was one of the men who possess
the useful knack of knowing when the tide of
their affairs is at the flood; so when Mr. Ford
asked him to come down and fight the Liberal
battle at Chayford in Edgar's stead, Paul consented
without an hour's delay.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the campaign Joanna came home,
completely restored to health, bringing Isabel with her;
and the inhabitants of the Cottage gave themselves up
body and soul to the election, and talked and thought and
dreamed of nothing else.  Great was the excitement all
over England, and Chayford was no exception to the rule.
For three weeks Paul made several speeches per day, and
was treated as if he were a combination of Juggernaut and
a popular preacher, with a flavour of Royalty thrown in.
</p>

<p>
Everybody in the town, including even the babies and
the cats, wore colours, if it were nothing better than a
scrap of tea paper; and there was all that delicious love
of fighting in the air which makes an election like a
glorious war with no death or danger in it.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it fun?" exclaimed Isabel one day.  "I adore
every minute of it.  It makes you hate the other side
with such an exquisite frenzy of hatred, which has neither
malice nor uncharitableness in it and yet which is so
charmingly violent while it lasts."
</p>

<p>
"I know," agreed Joanna, "it is that nice sort of
hatred which would never let you really injure people,
but which makes you want their chimneys to smoke and
their hats to blow off."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "And your love for your own side
is equally enjoyable.  I assure you I feel the most
fervent glow of affection for all the Liberals in
Chayford&mdash;just as if they were relations and it was Christmas
Day."
</p>

<p>
"Yet all the time you know that these feelings will
completely die out within a week of the declaration of
the poll!" added Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do; that is why they are so delightful.
Feelings that last, take a good deal out of you I
have discovered; the really delicious sort are those that
you think will last for ever and that you know won't,"
said Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid, my dear girl, that you are becoming an
epicure in emotions," remarked Paul, who had just come
in.
</p>

<p>
"I know I am; an election, supervening on a love-affair,
is enough to intoxicate any woman, especially when
the beloved object and the candidate are one.  You can't
think what glorious thrills I have all down my back when
the crowds applaud you.  Liberalism and love combined
so overwhelm my soul that I feel you are the only man
in the whole world, and the English nation rolled into
one; and I am as tearful as if people were singing 'God
Save the Queen' and 'Auld Robin Gray' at the same
time.  Oh! it is a delicious feeling, and I am eternally
grateful to you for giving it to me."
</p>

<p>
Paul beamed with delight, but, being a man, did not
say pretty things before a third person; Isabel, being a
woman, did.
</p>

<p>
"I adore elections," she continued, waltzing round
the room, "they are simply heavenly!"
</p>

<p>
"A general election and my idea of heaven are by no
means synonymous," replied her lover quietly.
</p>

<p>
"My idea of heaven is pretty much the same as
Beatrice's," Isabel said; "I shall go 'where the bachelors
sit, and there live as merry as the day is long'.  I shall
say, 'Please reserve the place next to Mr. Paul Seaton
for me'; and if I find it already occupied, there will be
unpleasantness, and I shall contest the seat."
</p>

<p>
"You are very brilliant to-day."  And Paul looked at
her proudly.  She was worth looking at just then, as she
had dressed herself entirely in blue, the Liberal colour in
Chayford; and a woman always looks her best when her
gown is of the same shade as her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It is this lovely election!  It has got into my head."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't let it tire you; I would rather lose the
seat than that you should knock yourself up in helping me
to win it."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you have warned her," said Joanna, "I
am sure she works too hard, but she won't listen to me.
She has too much spirit for her strength."
</p>

<p>
An anxious expression came over Paul's face.  "You
do look a bit tired, Isabel," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!" she replied; then she looked at herself in
the glass.  "Should you call me a brilliant woman or a
sweet woman?" she asked thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Brilliant," replied Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Both," replied Paul.
</p>

<p>
"That is absurd!  I can't be both; nobody could."
</p>

<p>
"But you are."
</p>

<p>
Isabel carefully arranged her fringe: "That is just
like your interesting but incomprehensible sex, my good
sir.  If you happen to care for a woman, you at once
endow her with every possible virtue, totally irrespective
of the fact that some of the virtues won't go together."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! that's what we do, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Now we women behave differently.  If we love
a man, we don't plaster him over with all the good
qualities; but we merely say that the virtues he doesn't
possess are not virtues at all, and that no decent man
would be seen with such things.  But though the <i>modus
operandi</i> in each case is different, the result is the same;
that is to say, the beloved object in both instances has
the monopoly of human excellencies."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must be off," said Joanna rising; "I have
some work to do."
</p>

<p>
After his sister had left the room, Paul made up his
deficiency in the saying of pretty things.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Isabel?" asked Mrs. Seaton of her
daughter, as the latter was going out.
</p>

<p>
"With Paul in the drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton drew a sigh of perfect contentment.
"That is all right."
</p>

<p>
"What they have to say to each other that they are
always wanting to be alone together, I cannot imagine,"
continued Joanna.  "I never said anything in my life to
anybody that a third person was not welcome to hear."
</p>

<p>
Her mother smiled.  "You have not said all that
there is to be said yet, then."
</p>

<p>
"Evidently not.  There are still some things in heaven
and earth undreamed of in my philosophy, and what
those two good people talk to each other about is one of
them.  If I were Isabel I could say all I wanted to say
before us all, I am certain."
</p>

<p>
"But you couldn't if you were Paul, my dear."
</p>

<p>
Joanna rolled up her umbrella.  "Well, mother, I
don't pretend to understand it; I could never exchange
confidences with anybody for all those hours on end,
least of all with a man.  I should be 'gravelled for lack
of matter' in no time; but those dear, silly people go on
for sixty minutes at a stretch, and then, if I happen to
disturb them, look at me as reproachfully as if they
had only had five seconds together, instead of 'a long
hour by Shrewsbury clock'."
</p>

<p>
Among the most enthusiastic of Paul's political
supporters was the faithful Martha.  Whenever she was
able, she attended his meetings, and regarded them
almost as means of grace.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe that the Pope of Rome or the President
of the Conference could make finer speeches than
Master Paul does," she said one day, as she was dusting
the drawing-room, and Joanna was arranging the flowers.
</p>

<p>
Joanna laughed.  "He is certainly a born orator,
Martha; he plays upon his audience as if he were playing
upon an organ."
</p>

<p>
"He does indeed, miss; and never seems at a loss
for a word.  I'm bound to say I didn't think Master Paul
had it in him to speak like that.  When you listen to
him, you wonder how the folks that think differently
have managed to keep themselves out of the lunatic
asylums; and that is the sort of speaking, and the sort of
preaching, that does real good, to my thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Still, I suppose, one ought to hear both sides of a
question," argued the wise Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, miss; there is nothing so unsettling.
Besides, where's the good?  Only one side can be right,
that is plain; and what is the use of wasting the time in
listening to the side that is wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"But, Martha, how can you tell which side is right
without hearing both?"
</p>

<p>
Martha dusted so fiercely that the ornaments fairly
danced.  "Bless your dear heart, if you are a woman,
you know who is right and who is wrong before you've
heard a single word; and if you are a man, you don't
know who is right and who is wrong after you've heard
all there is to be said.  But Mr. Paul's speeches are very
convincing, all the same; especially to folks as think the
same as he does to begin with."
</p>

<p>
"Oratory is a great power," remarked Joanna, half
to herself; "it must be lovely to see hundreds of people
hanging upon every word you utter, and to know that
you can sway them for the time being as it pleases you!"
</p>

<p>
"It must indeed, my dear&mdash;in fact, it seems almost too
great a power to be put into the hands of a man, even
though the man be dear Master Paul himself.  But it is a
wonder to me that men get on in the world as well as
they do, considering that they know nothing and can't
bear to be taught.  They say Providence takes special
care of children and naturals, so I suppose Providence
looks after men in the same sort of way.  If it wasn't
so, goodness knows what would become of them&mdash;the
unmarried ones in particular!"
</p>

<p>
"You used to be such a strong Conservative," Joanna
suggested, as she filled a vase with daffodils.
</p>

<p>
"So I was, miss; at one time the Conservatives
seemed to me to do the least mischief of the two parties,
because they were better able to mind their own business
and leave the country to look after itself.  As I have
often passed the remark, interference is the one thing
that I can't stand.  I have no objection to speaking a
word in season or out of season, whenever I think it is
needed; but I know my own business, and I won't stand
being taught it by anybody.  And, I take it, the country
is the same as me, miss; and doesn't want Governments
to come poking their noses into things that don't
concern them."
</p>

<p>
"So now I suppose you are a Liberal, Martha?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know that I'd go as far as that,"
replied Martha cautiously, "my father was a Liberal, and
the love of reform got into his blood till he couldn't eat
a bit of bacon without telling us how much better it
might have been cooked if he'd had the doing of it
himself.  I've noticed, miss, that when the master of a house
is a reformer, there's often trouble in the kitchen; so
I set my face against reforms of any kind, as it were."  And
the good woman shook her duster to and fro, as if
the whole Liberal party were wrapped up in it.
</p>

<p>
"Still some changes are improvements," persisted Joanna.
</p>

<p>
"I never came across them, miss; it seems to me
that a new way of governing the country is like a new
way of frying potatoes&mdash;the potatoes are no better
than they were before, and the grease always smells.
Still, my dear, I am no longer a Conservative.  Take my
word for that."
</p>

<p>
"What made you change your politics?" Joanna asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the way the Conservatives have turned against
our Paul.  As long as they kept themselves to themselves,
and acted according to their lights, I had no objections to
them; though I confess they sometimes made mistakes,
like their betters.  But when they turned against Master
Paul, it was a different thing, and then I washed my
hands once for all of the whole boiling of them."
</p>

<p>
Joanna smiled, as she disposed of her last daffodil.
Martha's politics were so essentially feminine.  As long
as a political party contents itself with revolutionizing
States and annexing continents and disestablishing
Churches, and other trifling pastimes such as these, no
right-minded woman troubles her head about it; these
things amuse it and do not hurt her.  But when the
political party takes advantage of this patience and
forbearance on her part, and goes to the length of
actually contesting the seat in Parliament of some particular
man, the sleeping tigress wakes up and shows all the
claws wherewith provident Nature has endowed her.
Which conduct is, after all, only natural; and the offending
faction has no one but itself to blame.
</p>

<p>
But it is the same with parties as with individuals;
if one gives them an inch they take an ell.
</p>

<p>
At last the day of the Chayford election dawned; and&mdash;as
is the way of election days&mdash;it was so long, that it
seemed as if the sun had stood still to watch the battle,
as it did in the time of Joshua.  But it came to an end
at last; and the little party at the Cottage sat up till
midnight awaiting Paul and the result.  At first everybody
said it would be a walk-over; but anybody who knows
anything about electioneering will be aware that,
however certain a seat may be, and however enormous the
majority last time, fears come with fighting, whilst
agonizing doubts foreshadow the declaration of the poll.
</p>

<p>
Paul's little home-circle felt very anxious; and the
more they doubted the result, the more they kept repeating
that there was no room for doubt at all.  The Liberal
majority at Chayford at the last election had been nine
hundred; and they continually assured each other (and
themselves) that a majority of that size could no more
melt away than an Alp could.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said Mr. Seaton, "though of course it
might have diminished, a majority of that size could not
possibly have transformed itself into a minority in three
years."  He was thinking to himself that if only four
hundred and fifty voters had gone over to the other side,
Paul would be beaten.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," replied Joanna, "the result really
is a foregone conclusion; it is only a question as to the
size of the majority.  She felt sure that the Conservative
papers could not write as they did, if they had not
grounds for their hope of which she knew nothing.
</p>

<p>
"It is really absurd to think that a mere boy like
Lord Gailey should beat a brilliant politician like Paul;
the idea is simply ludicrous!" exclaimed Isabel; but she
wished to goodness that Paul had not had an aristocrat for
his opponent, as there is an underlying respect for titles at
the bottom of every British heart.
</p>

<p>
"It is no use our expecting Paul for a couple of hours
yet," remarked Paul's mother; "it would be impossible
for him to be here before then."  She was feeling that
something dreadful must have happened&mdash;either that the
mob had killed Paul or else had not elected him&mdash;otherwise
he would have been at home an hour ago.
</p>

<p>
And so they went on telling little comforting fibs to
each other, and inwardly wondering how much longer this
suspense could be endured.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly they heard the sound of wheels, and the
stamping and shouting of a multitude.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is," said Mr. Seaton gently; and he went
very white and took his wife's hand.
</p>

<p>
Joanna and Isabel were past speaking; so they tried
to laugh&mdash;and failed.
</p>

<p>
The noise grew louder.  The crowd had taken the
horses out of Paul's carriage, and were drawing it along
with deafening cheers.  At last they pulled up at the
Cottage gate, and Paul sprang out and thanked them,
and rushed inside.
</p>

<p>
"It is all right!" he cried, "I am in with a majority
of twelve hundred."
</p>

<p>
Then he went straight up to Isabel and kissed her
before them all.
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad I have won," he said simply, "because
it gives me something to give to you, who have given me
so much."
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass that the old wastes and the former
desolations were built up and repaired in the life of Paul
Seaton: and the name of the builder and repairer was
Love.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the election&mdash;while Paul was helping
a brother candidate and Joanna was working in her
district&mdash;Isabel made her confession to Paul's father and
mother.  She told them the whole story: how she had
written <i>Shams and Shadows</i> in a fit of temper&mdash;how Paul
had saved her from the consequences of her mad act&mdash;how
she had selfishly let him bear the blame&mdash;how
his love for her had at last conquered the weakness
and worldliness of her nature, and taught her that it is not
in the power of outside things to make a woman happy&mdash;and
how she had promised to keep the secret all her life,
after she had once told the truth to his own people.
</p>

<p>
"I could not rest till I had your forgiveness," she
said in conclusion, "but if you will only say you forgive
me, I have promised I will never mention the subject
again."
</p>

<p>
"I forgive you utterly, my child," replied the minister;
"the deed shall be blotted out as though it had never
been; and I thank my son for having taught me how
divine a thing sometimes is human love."
</p>

<p>
"And you?" whispered Isabel to Mrs. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
Paul's mother took Isabel in her arms.  "Of course
I forgive you, my dear one, because Paul has forgiven
you, and because you have loved much; and I thank you
for having given my son back to me again."
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Isabel softly, "the Paul that
you know, never could have written that horrid book, so
you felt that there were two Pauls."
</p>

<p>
"That was just it," Mrs. Seaton replied, "and I
could not make the two Pauls agree with one another in
my mind.  But now you have not only given the old
Paul back to me; you have shown me that he is not
merely as good as I believed he was, but infinitely nobler
and better than I had dreamed.  I did not think that
my son could ever have written <i>Shams and Shadows</i>;
but, on the other, hand, I did not think that he could
ever have performed so noble an act of self-sacrifice as
this.  So you have restored him to me fourfold."
</p>

<p>
"I can never forgive myself," sobbed Isabel.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Seaton drew the weeping girl close to her.
"My dear, you must, for Paul's sake.  Remember he
loves you so much, that he could not forgive anybody for
not forgiving you."
</p>

<p>
"And we must not forget," added the minister, "that
it is love for you which has made Paul into the man he
is; so you have had much to do with the making of Paul,
and therefore his mother and I love you for it."
</p>

<p>
"I did not do it.  It was God who made Paul what
he is, and I was just the instrument."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Seaton smiled.  "Exactly, my dear; but there
is nothing remarkable in that.  The man who does the
most, is nothing more than God's instrument for fulfilling
His purposes; and the man who does the least, is no less
than that.  But we love best the instruments whereby
the most good is wrought; and so also, I think, does
God."
</p>

<p>
Paul and his mother were left together for a few
minutes that evening.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, "Isabel has told me everything."
</p>

<p>
Paul's face fell.  "I am sorry she told you, mother;
but she would do it."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be sorry, Paul; it is the greatest joy to me to
find that I have nothing for which to blame my dear son;
but that he has been all that I believed and hoped, and
far more."
</p>

<p>
"Still, I had rather that you blamed me than that
you blamed her; that is the one thing that I could not
bear even from you, mother."
</p>

<p>
"I do not blame her as I blamed you; the two cases
are so different.  Don't you know that when a woman is
angry she says far more than she means, but that a
man&mdash;however angry&mdash;never says as much?  So one can
hardly pass the same judgment on the utterances of
both."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked relieved.  "You think then that she was&mdash;but
no; I may find fault with what she writes, but
never with what she is; and no one else shall find fault
with her at all.  You will remember that this confidence
is sacred, mother; and that no one but my father and
Joanna must ever share it with you."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; you may trust us, Paul."
</p>

<p>
"And you will love Isabel always?"
</p>

<p>
"Always, dear; both for your sake and her own."

CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><br>
Life in London.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  If you will only give me time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And likewise opportunity,<br>
  To earth's high places I will climb<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And govern the community.<br>
</p>

<p>
One summer's day it happened that Mr. Kesterton
gave a tea-party on the terrace of the House
of Commons in honour of the Robert Thistletowns,
the Paul Seatons and Lady Farley.  It
was one of those broiling afternoons, when all the world
longs for shade and a breeze; and these two luxuries
are almost always to be found on the terrace at
Westminster.  The latter is sometimes found inside the walls
as well; but this "indoor relief" cannot be depended
upon.  Everybody knows that when the two Houses of
Parliament agree, there are few things that they cannot
compass; so when they combine to cast a pleasant
shade&mdash;and get the river Thames to help them with a
cool breeze or two&mdash;they naturally succeed in producing
the most refreshing atmosphere that is to be found in
London in July.
</p>

<p>
Isabel loved going to the House now; for to her "inward
eye" St. Stephen's had suddenly developed&mdash;from
being a mere uninteresting historical antiquity and dry
political fact&mdash;into an effective and suitable background
for the figure of her husband.  Therefore the place was
worth seeing as often as she had time to see it; and she
was absorbingly interested in everything that she saw.
But to her this afternoon was a special occasion; for Paul
had made his first great speech in a full-dress debate
(and his reputation at the same time), and was receiving
congratulations on all sides.  Isabel and her aunt had
heard the speech from behind the gilt lattice of the
ladies' gallery; while it was being delivered, the former
felt that here at last was the ideal statesman for whom
England had waited through the ages; while the latter
decided that Paul spoke like a man and looked like a
gentleman, and that Isabel might have done worse.
</p>

<p>
When it was tea-time Mr. Kesterton came to fetch
them down to the terrace; and their progress was
punctuated by compliments on Paul's success from all the
members that they met.
</p>

<p>
Isabel knew what admiration of herself was like; she
had lived on it all her life, and had thought that there
was nothing better.  Now she found that there was.
</p>

<p>
"How many members are killed every year from
tumbling down this pitch-dark staircase?" she inquired
of her host as they proceeded to the terrace.
</p>

<p>
"That, my dear lady, is a State secret which I am
not at liberty to divulge.  We never talk about it.  We
just hide them under the stairs, like the princes in the
Tower, and no one asks any questions."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it would be unconstitutional for public
men to see which way they were going?" suggested
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Most unconstitutional," answered the Cabinet
Minister; "and most detrimental to anything in the
shape of a forward policy.  Besides, if it were not for
that dark staircase, what should we leaders do with the
private members who have private opinions?  We should
have to dissemble our love so far as to kick them
downstairs; and that also would be unconstitutional."
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.  "I see; you recommend the Amy
Robsart cure."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Laisser faire</i> is a most successful course of
treatment," added Lady Farley; "I have spent my life in
allowing people sufficient rope, and the victims of my
indulgence hang in rows, like the tails of Little Bo-peep's
flock."
</p>

<p>
Then Paul met them, and was patted on the back by
Mr. Kesterton and praised by Lady Farley.  Isabel felt
she could not speak to him about his speech before all
these people&mdash;it would be like saying one's prayers at a
ball; so she just looked into his eyes and smiled; and
Paul understood.
</p>

<p>
"Here are the Thistletowns," said Mr. Kesterton,
going forward to receive his guests.
</p>

<p>
Lord Bobby still limped, though he was limping along
the road to complete recovery; and as he had won his
V.C.&mdash;and Violet&mdash;his cup of happiness was full.  As for his
wife, she was lovelier than ever; she had got what she
wanted, and there is nothing so becoming to a woman as
that.
</p>

<p>
"Very glad to see you, Lady Robert," exclaimed her
host, "I hope your husband is getting all right again,
though with such a nurse as he now has I cannot blame
him if he lengthens out the long-drawn sweetness of his
convalescence to its fullest extent."
</p>

<p>
Violet held out a daintily gloved hand.  "Oh! he is
much better, thank you: aren't you, Bobby?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I am," agreed the invalid; "I'm nearly fit
again now, but I've had a narrow shave of it with that
silly old leg of mine.  Those Johnnies of doctors wanted
to chop it off at one time, and then my wife and I would
only have had three legs between us, like the Isle of Man.
Shouldn't we, Vi?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! don't dear," pleaded Violet, with a pretty little
shudder.  "I cannot bear to hear you talk like that."
</p>

<p>
It was a very merry tea-party; they all liked each
other, and the weather was fine&mdash;two most important
ingredients in a social success.  Isabel especially was
delightfully happy and important; she felt that Paul was
standing on his own ground at last, and that it was very
creditable ground to be standing upon; and she took
therefore a proprietary interest in the House of Commons,
and all that appertained to it.
</p>

<p>
"What would happen if I were to walk on the part
of the terrace reserved for members?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"The shade of Cromwell would exclaim, 'Remove
that bauble!' and then you would be removed by the
officials of the House, and burnt in effigy every 5th of
November," Lord Robert hastened to assure her.
</p>

<p>
"Should I, Mr. Kesterton?"
</p>

<p>
"That is the usual punishment for such an offence."
</p>

<p>
"But I am an M.P.-ress myself, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Then in that case you might only be named by the
Speaker," replied Mr. Kesterton, "that is the next
worst thing."
</p>

<p>
"I hope that my husband shows no signs of becoming
an independent member," said Isabel; "because I
don't approve of independent members."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," answered her host, "he is a credit
alike to the woman who trained him and the party that
owns him."
</p>

<p>
"I am thankful for that; I think that people who
make their own opinions are almost as bad as people
who make their own clothes."
</p>

<p>
The front-bench man nodded his approval of this
sentiment, as he dispensed the strawberries and cream.
</p>

<p>
"What is done to members who have opinions of
their own and are troublesome to their leaders?"
Mrs. Paul Seaton further inquired.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kesterton's eyes twinkled.  "The correct thing
is for them to be hanged, drawn and quartered; but, if
they happen to have charming wives, the sentence is
generally commuted to transportation for life to the House
of Lords."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Well, I am glad to hear that my husband
behaves himself prettily, and that you approve of him."
</p>

<p>
"He certainly behaves himself prettily, my dear
lady; and I always approve of and nearly always agree
with him.  The only difference between us is that he is
still young enough to aim at perfection, whilst I have
learnt to be satisfied with success."
</p>

<p>
"You see, my wife is anxious to learn the customs of
the House," said Paul.
</p>

<p>
"Then, my dear Isabel, let me give you one piece of
valuable information," chimed in Lord Bobby, "do not
for a moment imagine that because our old friend Guy
Fawkes was reprimanded for trying to blow up the
Houses of Parliament, there is anything to prevent
you from blowing up the members separately.  This
custom is not only lawful, but frequently expedient; and
in certain cases&mdash;such as your own for instance&mdash;not
only expedient, but absolutely necessary."
</p>

<p>
"You know nothing at all about it," replied Isabel
with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me; my father is a member of the Upper
House, and&mdash;until my marriage&mdash;I resided principally at
home."
</p>

<p>
Every one laughed, and Paul said: "You must not
go about telling the secrets of the Upper House in that
way, Thistletown."
</p>

<p>
Bobby shook his head reprovingly.  "Don't crush
all the spirit out of that poor little thing.  She has a
right to know that she may bully you if she wants to do
so, and that nobody can stop her.  You shouldn't take
advantage of your dear wife's well-known meekness and
submission, Seaton; you really shouldn't.  If you had
married a woman who could speak up for herself, it
would have been different.  But I cannot bear to see
cruelty to dumb animals."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if a meek wife would have suited Paul,"
remarked Lady Farley, leisurely sipping her tea.
</p>

<p>
"I expect so," Bobby answered, "because he has
chosen the other sort; just like gouty men always drink
champagne and port (when their wives aren't looking)."
</p>

<p>
"I have often noticed," said Mr. Kesterton, "that
men, as a rule, fall in love with the exact opposite of the
type that they theoretically approve of."
</p>

<p>
"I have noticed more than that," added Lady Farley;
"having selected, as you say, the exact opposite, they set
about transforming the object selected into their ideal
type.  This seems to my ignorant mind a waste of time
and trouble, when the market is overstocked with their
ideal types already."
</p>

<p>
"I know what you mean," agreed Isabel, "the man
who admires silent women, loses his heart to a chatterbox,
and spends the rest of his mortal life in teaching her
to hold her tongue."
</p>

<p>
Lady Farley nodded.  "In the same way, a man who
applauds female brains, is carried off his feet by a pretty
fool, and then wears her and himself out by trying to
educate her."
</p>

<p>
"It is stupid of men to behave like that," said Violet
Thistletown.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," argued her aunt, "it is stupid of the
women not to adapt themselves."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that.  How should you like to
have to pretend to a man that you were not clever, Aunt
Caroline?" inquired Isabel, who, having been married for
only a few months, naturally imagined that she knew all
there was to be known concerning the management of
Man.
</p>

<p>
"I have already done so, my dear, for thirty years,
with the utmost success.  To this day my husband always
insists upon fighting my battles for me."
</p>

<p>
"With what results?" asked Mr. Kesterton.
</p>

<p>
"The battles, of course, are lost; but what does that
matter?  The process stimulates his chivalrous instincts,
and so increases his attachment to me.  It is far more
important that a woman's husband should think that he
knows better than she does, than that the world should
see that he doesn't."
</p>

<p>
The three men fully agreed with Lady Farley.
</p>

<p>
"The sole duty of woman is to be charming," she
continued in her pretty drawl, "and if only the women
of to-day would do their hair properly instead of letting
their heads run upon their wrongs, and would study how
to amuse men instead of how to solve life-problems, there
would soon be no wrongs and no life problems left."
</p>

<p>
"Also women would not talk about Art with a capital
A," agreed Paul, "Art with a capital A always bores me."
</p>

<p>
"My experience is that a woman's heart has no <i>he</i> in
it when she spells it with a capital A," said Isabel wisely.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how it is," mused Lady Farley, putting
down her tea-cup, "but women, who spell abstract
nouns with capital letters, generally seem independent of
such artificial aids to beauty as soap and water and hair
brushes."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kesterton smiled; Lady Farley amused him
extremely.  "Then doesn't Milady claim equal rights
with men?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Milady raised her delicate eyebrows in well-bred
surprise.  "Of course not; why should I?  The cleverest
woman should be ready to knock under to the stupidest
man if necessary&mdash;or at any rate to make him think that
she does."
</p>

<p>
"I am shocked, Lady Farley, to hear you inculcating
deceitfulness."
</p>

<p>
"I am not inculcating deceitfulness&mdash;I am preaching
wisdom.  When I was young I used to treat men as I
treated women, and tell them the whole truth about
everything.  But it didn't answer; they couldn't stand it."
</p>

<p>
"So now you tell them stories, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I still give them the truth, but I offer it to
them in a peptonized form, so that they can digest it
without discomfort."
</p>

<p>
"But what are the pretty, stupid women to do when
the men try to educate them?" asked Violet, who was
generally conversationally left a long way behind the
rest of the field.
</p>

<p>
Her aunt gently instructed her.  "Their course is
even simpler than that of the clever ones.  They have
merely to listen to their husband's opinions, and repeat
them verbatim as their own.  A man always thinks a
woman clever whose thoughts are identical with his&mdash;but
when her expression of them is also identical, he
considers her absolutely brilliant."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kesterton laughed heartily.  "You have learnt
a great many things, my dear lady."
</p>

<p>
"I have lived a long time and I have kept my eyes
open.  Nevertheless there are two things which I have
never been able to find out; namely, why people fall in
love, and why Punch is published on a Wednesday."
</p>

<p>
"Then Paul is even cleverer than you are, Aunt
Caroline," interpolated Paul's admiring wife, "because
there is nothing that he doesn't know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes there is," said Paul modestly; "I never
know what to talk to young girls about, or what seven
times eight are."
</p>

<p>
"I am with you there, Seaton," remarked the host;
"the only things in which I take no interest are young
girls and bimetallism."
</p>

<p>
"What is bimetallism?" asked Lady Robert.
</p>

<p>
Her husband looked appealingly round the table.
"Think what my married life will be if she begins
asking questions like that already!"  Then he turned to
his wife.  "Bimetallism, my dear Violet, is the opposite
of monometallism; let that suffice you."
</p>

<p>
"But what is monometallism?" persisted Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Monometallism is the opposite of monomania," replied
Isabel; but Paul endeavoured&mdash;though of course
vainly&mdash;to explain the terms to his wife's pretty cousin.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot stand young girls myself," agreed Lady
Farley, "they are afraid of me, and I have no mercy on
them."
</p>

<p>
"Then you ought to have," said Lord Bobby.
</p>

<p>
"I do not see the compulsion."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Lady Farley," he continued, "you must
remember that the quality of mercy should not be
measured out by teaspoonfuls in a medicine-glass, but
should be sent round in a watering-cart by the County
Council."
</p>

<p>
"I know that," replied Lady Farley laughing, "nevertheless
young girls are simple, and I never can stand
simplicity."
</p>

<p>
"Neither can I," agreed Mr. Kesterton, "simple
dinners and simple women are alike abhorrent to me,
because they both always agree with me and that is so
tiresome."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, it will be interesting when Seaton
begins to teach you to hold your tongue," remarked
Bobby to Isabel, "if he can accomplish that, he will be
able to unite the offices of Prime Minister, Commander-in-Chief
and Archbishop of Canterbury in his own person,
as he will have proved that the impossible is mere play
to him."
</p>

<p>
"He will never try to teach me, you see, because he
enjoys my conversation more than anything."
</p>

<p>
"Does he?" said Bobby softly.  "Do you know I
once went on a switchback railway with a man who said
he enjoyed the motion more than anything? the next
thing he said was that he wished he was dead."
</p>

<p>
The talk rippled on till tea was over, and then they
all got up and walked about.  As Paul and Isabel were
leaning over the parapet and looking down into the
water, Mr. Kesterton and Lady Farley passed within
earshot, and the Cabinet Minister was saying: "I feel
certain that he will be in the Government before long;
there is no doubt he has a great future before him.  It
is a pity that he ever wrote that silly book, <i>Shams and
Shadows</i>; but this clever niece of yours will keep him
straight now.  The men with clever wives are not the
men who make mistakes, Lady Farley."
</p>

<p>
Paul looked down upon his wife and smiled; but the
eyes that Isabel raised to his were full of tears.
</p>

<p>
Not long after the tea-party on the terrace, Edgar
Ford dined at the Paul Seatons' pretty little house in
Kensington.  Mr. Madderley was there; also Mr. Seaton,
who was spending a few days with his son, and was very
much enjoying a sight of London under Isabel's auspices.
</p>

<p>
Edgar and Alice were to be married in the autumn;
and the former had already taken a house close to the
Stepney Settlement, and was making ready for his bride.
</p>

<p>
The conversation at dinner ran upon Edgar's work
among the poor; and he made the others both laugh
and cry at the mingled humour and pathos of his stories.
Mr. Seaton especially was interested in the doings of the
Settlement, and gave Edgar some valuable hints from
out of the stores of his own wisdom and experience.
</p>

<p>
"The thing that strikes me most forcibly," said
Edgar, when the servants had left the room, "is the
kindness of the poor to one another.  Underneath all
the squalor and sordidness of poverty, there is
something beautiful after all."
</p>

<p>
"You are right there," agreed Mr. Seaton.  "I have,
of course, worked much among the poor in my time, and
this phase of their character has never failed to impress
me."
</p>

<p>
"It is what I have always told you," cried Paul;
"human nature is a grand thing spoiled, but it is a grand
thing still."
</p>

<p>
"But human nature must not be taken in the aggregate,"
said Edgar, playing with his empty wine-glass;
"masses always represent their lowest component parts.
It is only when you deal with men and women individually,
that you discover the underlying beauty of their
characters.  I hate to hear classes condemned wholesale,
whether it be the frivolity of the rich or the brutality
of the poor that is held up to scorn."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," added Mr. Seaton; "there are frivolous
poor and brutal rich; and likewise there are saints to be
found equally in both classes, and more of them than we
any of us dream."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," remarked Isabel, "that love is the
leaven that leavens the whole lump.  It is only when
people begin to care for each other that the fineness of
human nature is seen.  I was horribly selfish myself till
I really cared for somebody, and then I gradually became
quite nice."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Madderley smiled, as he peeled a peach for his
hostess; he had watched Isabel's development with much
interest, and he perceived that she displayed wonderful
accuracy in diagnosing her own case.
</p>

<p>
"As long as you don't love anybody much, your character
is like a garden in winter," she continued; "one
virtue is under a glass shade, and another is covered over
with straw, and all of them are dreadfully pinched and
sickly.  Then love comes by, and it is summer; and your
garden rejoices and blossoms like the rose, without your
bothering about it at all."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless," said Madderley, "I think that love,
though admirable as a pastime, is a little too flimsy to be
designated an underlying principle."
</p>

<p>
Isabel tossed her head.  Madderley's cynicism always
irritated her.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you would say," she replied, "that there
is no more ennobling influence than beauty."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," rejoined the artist, serious for once in his
life, "what you call art, is the worship of beauty by the
human mind; what you call love, is the worship of beauty
by the human heart; and what you call religion, is the
worship of beauty by the human soul."
</p>

<p>
Isabel was silent.
</p>

<p>
"You are right in thinking that love for the beautiful
is to be found in strange places," said Edgar; "last
month a lot of children were sent down from Hampden
House into the country for a week; and one of the
poorest and most ragged of them said afterwards to
one of our Sisters: 'Oh!  Sister, it was all so beautiful
that it made me cry for you'.  That simply meant, as
you say, that the sight of natural beauty stimulated that
child's highest feelings, and made her long for the person
for whom she cared the most."
</p>

<p>
Isabel fully entered into the feelings of the little
ragged girl; she had felt exactly the same herself at the
State Concert.
</p>

<p>
"If the child hadn't loved the Sister first, the beauty
of the country would not have had power to touch her,"
she said, "love is the <i>Open Sesame</i> that lets in beauty,
and gives us eyes to see."
</p>

<p>
"I should put it just the other way," said Madderley;
"and say that beauty is the cause of love."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me that there is something deeper even
than that," argued Paul, "some innate fineness, proper
to human nature itself, which makes all these things
possible to it."
</p>

<p>
"It is often surprising," remarked his wife, "how
people are nearly always nice when one gets to know
them, and pierces through the outer husk of artificiality
which they wear before the world.  I detest heaps of
people that I have only met at dinner; but I think I like
everybody that I have ever had breakfast with."

<p>
The others laughed.

"Which simply means that the better one knows one's
fellow-creatures the better one thinks of them," added
Paul.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot offer an opinion," said Madderley, "I have
never been down to breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Paul turned to his father.  "You have not given us
your idea yet as to what is really the name of the
underlying power which leavens the whole lump of humanity,
and which Isabel calls love, and Madderley calls beauty,
and Edgar calls individualism, and I call human nature."
</p>

<p>
"I should call it by none of these names," replied
Mr. Seaton, "these are but the branches of a root which
goes deeper and is stronger than any of them, or than all
of them put together."
</p>

<p>
"Then what should you say is the name of this underlying
and yet exalting power?" asked Edgar.
</p>

<p>
The minister smiled.  "I am an old-fashioned man
and I use old-fashioned phrases," he said, "I should call
it the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ."
